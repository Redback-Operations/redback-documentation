These techniques enable restrictions, such as password complexity, to be applied to the passwords, preventing unauthorised users from accessing the server. Jenkins has the built-in permission options "Legacy mode," "Anyone can do everything," and "Logged-in users can do anything." Specialists advise against using these built-in techniques in favour of plugins for more sophisticated permission procedures. The two most well-known plugins for this purpose are Matrix Authorization Strategy and Role-based Authorization Strategy. These plugins offer significant flexibility for implementing PoLP (Principle of least privilege) by defining the privileges of anonymous users, authenticated users, or specified ones.
