# Future Plans

The intention of this page is to be a constantly changing list of needs for the platform.


### Add GitHub Actions Checklist

Add syntax to the GitHub Actions to automatically flag [common mistakes](https://redback-operations.github.io/redback-documentation/docs/documentation-maintenance/approval-guide), this will reduce repeating the same answers to pull requests constantly.

### Enforcement (and back-dated) Naming Schemes

Ideally, all files and folders should have the same naming scheme. Currently, they are a mix of everything.

### Image Folder Structure

Images should be enforced to have their own sub-folders, as currently most pages will just dump all their images into the img folder for that main folder. Likewise, all images should have a consistent naming scheme to make them identifiable to the file they are associated with.

### Revamp Tutorials

Create more sophisticated, easier to understand tutorials. As well as more advanced tutorials covering some of the plugins and other advanced tools on offer.

### Homepage Revamp

Currently the homepage is using the default Docusaurus template, Redback should utilise the skills on offer to make this more appealing.
