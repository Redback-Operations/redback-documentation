# Streamlit Tutorial

## Open-Source Python Framework

Streamlit is a powerful, open-source Python framework that empowers data scientists and AI/ML practitioners to rapidly build interactive data applications. Tailored for machine learning and data science projects, Streamlit simplifies the process of developing web apps that are both engaging and visually compelling, requiring only minimal code to get started.

# 1.  Installation and Setup

To get started with Streamlit, we need to install the library using pip. Make sure Python is already installed on your system, as Streamlit requires it.

1. **Install Streamlit:**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```sh
   pip install streamlit
   ```

2. **Verify Installation:**

    After installation, we can check if everything is set up correctly by running:

    ```sh
    streamlit hello
    ```

This will launch a sample web application, which is also featured on Streamlit's gallery page.
   
### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

It’s recommended to create a virtual environment for your project to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**

    Use the `cd` command to move to your project folder. For example:

    ```sh
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```

2. **Create the Virtual Environment:**
Run the following command to create a virtual environment named .venv:

    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    On Windows:

    ```
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    
    On macOS and Linux:

    ```
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```


### Installing Streamlit:
1. Install streamlit: With the virtual environment activated, run
```
pip install streamlit
```

2. Verify Streamlit Installation:
Check if Streamlit is installed correctly by running
```
streamlit --version       
```

## Troubleshooting:

    2. Create a new file named app.py
![alt text](images/image-19.png)

3. Write Your Streamlit Code:
Open app.py and write your Streamlit application code. Here’s an example of a simple Streamlit app:
```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("Hello Streamlit!")
st.write("This is my first Streamlit app.")

# Add some interactive widgets
name = st.text_input("Enter your name:")
if name:
    st.write(f"Hello, {name}!")

number = st.slider("Pick a number:", 0, 100)
st.write(f"Your number is {number}")
```
4. Run Your Streamlit App:
Open a terminal or Command Prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing your app.py file.
Run the Streamlit application:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

This command will start a local server and open your default web browser to http://localhost:8501, where you can see your Streamlit app running


# 4. Step-by-Step Guide to Code and Run a Streamlit App Using Anaconda
1. Set Up Your Project Directory:
    1. Choose a location on your system where you want to store your project files.
    2. Create a new directory for your project, for example, my_streamlit_app.

```
mkdir my_streamlit_app
```
```
cd my_streamlit_app
```

![alt text](images/image-20.png)

2. Create the app.py File:

    1. Open your text editor or IDE.
    2. Create a new file named app.py in the my_streamlit_app directory.

5. Run Your Streamlit App:
With the environment activated and while in the project directory, run your Streamlit app:

    ```
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    ![alt text](images/image-24.png)

    This command will start a local server and open the default web browser to http://localhost:8501, where we can see the Streamlit app running
![alt text](images/image-25.png)

Whenever any change is done to the source code,
![alt text](images/image-26.png)

It is updated automatically in the app. We select always re-run(Can manually re-run after each change is done too )

# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### STOPPING THE STREAMLIT SERVER:
When you run a Streamlit app using the command streamlit run app.py in the terminal, the server will continue to run and serve the Streamlit app until you stop it manually. 

1. **In the Terminal Window:**
Windows/Linux/macOS: Press Ctrl + C. This keyboard shortcut sends an interrupt signal to the terminal, which stops the Streamlit server.
2. **Alternative Method:**
If you started the Streamlit app in a terminal window that you don’t have access to, you can close the terminal window. This will also stop the Streamlit server.

### NAVIGATING BETWEEN DIRECTORIES:

Assuming your directory structure is like this:

```
D:\Team Project A\staging\
    ├── file_upload
    └── my_streamlit_app
```

-*To navigate from ```file_upload``` to ```my_streamlit_app```:*

**Navigate Up One Level:**
```
cd ..
```
