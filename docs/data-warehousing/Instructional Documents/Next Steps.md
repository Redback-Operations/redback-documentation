The Data Warehouse has come a long way but there is still work to do.

  

At the time of writing there are opportunities to:

  
  
- Implement the ability to bulk upload to the file upload service

- Refine and expand the pre-processing data in the file upload service to accommodate more dynamic transformations of different types of data/data types.

- Provide integration and orchestration designs to the existing data warehouse solutions

- Incorporate production data (not sample data) from Redback projects into the Data Warehouse solutions in a meaningful way.
