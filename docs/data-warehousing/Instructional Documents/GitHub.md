It is important to clone the GitHub repository [redback-data-warehouse](https://github.com/Redback-Operations/redback-data-warehouse) to your working directory on the virtual machine. In order to push your changes and work to the GitHub repository it needs to be on the virtual machine not PC. 

There are vast resources for working in GitHub including resources in the Redback Teams channel.

Here is a Redback video series that explains the steps to incorporate GitHub. You can also contact your mentor for further information.
