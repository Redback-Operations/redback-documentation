## Information services backup procedures

- Backup Server
  - Daily, journal receivers are changed at 6:00 AM and at 6:00 PM.
  - Daily, a save of changed objects in the following libraries and directories is done at 1:00 AM:

1. LIB_ACCOUNTING
2. LIB_HR
3. DIR_PAYROLL
4. DIR_OPERATIONS
5. LIB_SALES
6. LIB_MARKETING
7. DIR_SUPPORT
8. LIB_IT

This procedure also saves the journals and journal receivers.

- - On Sunday at 4:30 AM a complete save of the system is done.
    - All save media is stored off-site in a vault at SafeDataStorage, located in Melbourne.
- Personal Computer
  - It is recommended that all personal computers be backed up. Copies of the personal computer files should be uploaded to the server on every Friday at 5:00 PM, just before a complete save of the system is done. It is then saved with the normal system save procedure. This provides for a more secure backup of personal computer-related systems where a local area disaster could wipe out important personal computer systems.

## Disaster Recovery Procedures

#### Emergency Response Procedures

Emergency response aims primarily at saving lives and reducing destruction caused by fire, natural disaster or other critical incidents. The following are immediate activities:

- **Evacuation Procedures:** Clearly identified exits and the way to evacuate. Regular practices should be done to ensure that all staff members know evacuation procedures.
- **Emergency Services Notification:** Immediate contact with fire, medical or police services is necessary when required.
- **Emergency Command Center:** A command center either on-site or nearby for coordinating the emergency response has to be set up.

#### Recovery Actions Procedures

These procedures are essential in preserving the necessary data processing operational tasks that enable them to continue with minimal interruptions:

- **Data Backup:** Regular backups of all important data should be made and stored in a remote site. These back-ups go through regular tests so that they can be restored if need arises.
- **Cloud Services:** Access to applications and information from cloud computing resources should be maintained remotely.
- **Alternate Processing Facility:** A third-party facility agreement or mobile site use for business continuity.

These are the steps to take in order to recover data processing systems quickly after a disaster:

- **Assessment and Evaluation:** Evaluate what happened in terms of its impact on data processing systems.
- **Restoration Plan**: Put into effect a well-structured plan to restore hardware, software, and data from backups.
- **Testing:** After restoration, confirm that all the systems have been restored back to normal functioning again including security wise.

## Disaster Action Checklist

#### Plan Initiation

1. **Notify Senior Management:** Immediately inform senior management about the occurrence of the disaster.
2. **Setup Disaster Recovery Team:** Communicate with and assign roles for members of the disaster recovery team.  

3. **Degree of Disaster:** Find out how much extent and effect has this calamity had on Firm operations.  

4. **Application Recovery Plan:** This should be done based on the magnitude of damage it has caused with continuous monitoring as required.  

5. **Backup Site Coordination:** Fix timing and coordination with an alternative site which will host IT department should things go worse at current location?  

6. **Vendor and Personnel Contact:** All hardware/software vendors who are needed must be notified as well as all other employees involved.  

7. **Service Disruption Notification:** Users need to know when they can expect service interruptions to occur or how long these may continue for.

#### Follow-Up Checklist

1. **Logistics and Supplies:** make arrangements for any cash emergency, transport means, accommodation and food services that may be necessary.  

2. **Communication Setup:** Verify that all team members have all contact info and create a user participation plan.  

3. **Office Setup**: In case of an emergency arrange for backup office supplies, rent or purchase necessary equipment and manage mail in/out deliveries.  

4. **Operational Setup:** Establish the order in which applications will be run; determine workstations and offline equipment requirements; check forms needed for each application to confirm they are operational.  

5. **Preparation for Movement:** Make sure everything is checked before it is moved to the backup site. This includes taking inventory of all data and equipment. Plan for additional item transportation.  

6. **Documentation & Maps:** Generate multiple copies of every system or operational documentation, procedural manuals, as well as directions how to reach the backup location.  

7. **Insurance notification:** Inform insurance companies about the accident so that processing claims can begin.

#### Recovery Start-Up Procedures

1. **Disaster recovery services notification:** Getting in touch with disaster recovery services on chosen recovery plan. The countdown begins when notice is received at guaranteed delivery time.

6\. Depending on communication needs, notify telephone company Telstra of possible emergency line changes.

7\. Begin setting up power and communications at the mobile site.

a. Power and communications are prearranged to hook into when trailer arrives.

b. At the point where telephone lines come into the building at the central junction, break the current linkage to the administration controllers. These lines are rerouted to lines going to the mobile site. They are linked to modems at the mobile site.

c. This action could conceivably require Teleco Inc. to redirect lines at the central complex to a more secure area in case of disaster.

8\. When the trailer arrives, plug into power and do necessary checks.

9\. Plug into the communications lines and do necessary checks.

10\. Begin loading system from backups.

11\. Begin normal operations as soon as possible:

a. Execute daily jobs as scheduled.

b. Perform daily saves to ensure no data is lost during the recovery phase.

c. Conduct weekly saves as part of the ongoing data protection strategy.

12\. Plan a schedule to back up the system in order to restore it on a home-base computer when a permanent site is available. Continue using regular system backup procedures to maintain data integrity.

13\. Secure mobile site and distribute keys as required.

14\. Keep a maintenance log on mobile equipment.

## Recovery plan-hot site

The disaster recovery service provides an alternate hot site. The site has a backup system for temporary use while the home site is being reestablished.

1. Notify the Disaster Recovery Coordinator of the nature of the disaster and of its desire for a hot site.
2. Request air shipment of modems to the hot site for communications.

7. Review the checklist for all necessary materials before departing to the hot site.
8. Make sure that the disaster recovery team at the disaster site has the necessary information to begin restoring the site.
9. Provide for travel expenses (cash advance).
10. After arriving at the hot site, contact home base to establish communications procedures.
11. Review materials brought to the hot site for completeness.
12. Begin loading the system from the save USB Devices.
13. Begin normal operations as soon as possible:
    1. Daily jobs
    2. Daily saves
    3. Weekly saves
14. Plan the schedule to back up the hot-site system in order to restore on the home-base computer.

## Restoring the entire system

To get your system back to the way it was before the disaster, use the procedures on recovering after a complete system loss in the _Backup and Recovery_

_Before You Begin:_ Find the following USB Devices, equipment, and information from the on- site USB Devicesvault or the off-site storage location:

- If you install from the alternate installation device, you need both your USB Devices media and the CD-ROM media containing the Licensed Internal Code.
- All USB Devices from the most recent complete save operation
- The most recent USB Devices from saving security data (SAVSECDTA or SAVSYS)
- The most recent USB Devices from saving your configuration, if necessary
- All USB Devices containing journals and journal receivers saved since the most recent daily save operation
- All USB Devices from the most recent daily save operation
- PTF list (stored with the most recent complete save USB Devices, weekly save USB Devices, or both)
- USB Deviceslist from most recent complete save operation
- USB Deviceslist from most recent weekly save operation
- USB Deviceslist from daily saves
- History log from the most recent complete save operation
- History log from the most recent weekly save operation
- History log from the daily save operations
- The _Software Installation_ book
- The _Backup and Recovery_ book
- Telephone directory
- Modem manual
- Tool kit

## Rebuilding process

The management team must assess the damage and begin the reconstruction of a new data center.

If the original site must be restored or replaced, the following are some of the factors to consider:

- What is the projected availability of all needed computer equipment?
- Will it be more effective and efficient to upgrade the computer systems with newer equipment?
- What is the estimated time needed for repairs or construction of the data site?
- Is there an alternative site that more readily could be upgraded for computer purposes?

Once the decision to rebuild the data center has been made, go to Disaster site rebuilding section.

## Testing the disaster recovery plan
