### APPLICATION CONTROL PROCEDURES

     Application Approval and Whitelisting
         - Application Submission: Participants who require new software for their tasks must apply request to the IT Support Team or Security Team. The request must include the application's name, purpose, source, and justification for its use.
         - Evaluation Criteria: The IT or Security Team will evaluate the requested application based on:
             - Security: The application's security features, such as encryption, patch history, and vendor reputation.
             - Compatibility: Compatibility with existing systems, VMs, and digital environments.
             - Compliance: Adherence to licensing agreements, regulations, and internal policies.
             - Operational Need: The application's relevance to the project or task at hand.
         - Approval Process: Upon successful evaluation, the application will be approved and added to the whitelist, allowing it to be installed and executed within Redbackâ€™s digital environment.
         - Whitelisting Management: The whitelist of approved applications will be maintained by the IT Support Team and reviewed periodically to ensure it remains up-to-date and relevant.
           
     Blacklisting and Unauthorized Applications
         - Identifying Threats: Any application identified as malicious, unauthorized, or irrelevant to project work will be added to the blacklist by the Security Team. This includes applications flagged during monitoring, audits, or by third-party security advisories.- - - -  Blocking Execution: Blacklisted applications are automatically blocked from being executed on any system within the Redback digital environment, including VMs and personal devices used for project work.
         - Responding to Violations: If an attempt to execute a blacklisted or unauthorized application is detected, the incident must be reported immediately to the Security Team. The involved system will be isolated, and an investigation will be conducted to determine the cause and impact.

     Continuous Monitoring and Logging
         - Application Monitoring: The Security Team must continuously monitor application usage across all systems, VMs, and digital environments. This includes monitoring the installation, execution, and update activities of all applications.
         - Log Management: All application-related activities must be logged, including successful and unsuccessful attempts to install, execute, or update applications. These logs will be integrated into the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system for real-time analysis and long-term storage.
         - Anomaly Detection: The SIEM system will be configured to detect anomalies, such as attempts to run unauthorized software, unusual patterns in application usage, or potential security breaches. Alerts will be generated and reviewed by the Security Team.

     Software Updates and Patching
         - Regular Updates: All approved applications must be kept up to date with the latest security patches and updates. The IT Support Team is responsible for scheduling and applying these updates across all relevant systems.
         - Controlled Rollout: Before deploying updates or new applications, they must be tested in a controlled environment, such as a dedicated VM, to ensure compatibility and security. Only after successful testing will the updates be rolled out to the broader digital environment.
         - Patch Management: A patch management schedule will be maintained, ensuring that all critical updates are applied promptly, and that legacy applications are reviewed for potential security risks.


### APPLICATION USAGE IN SPECIFIC TEAMS

**SecDevOps Team**
 - Development Tools: All development tools, IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), and CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines must be approved through the whitelisting process. Regular code reviews and security scans must be conducted using approved tools.
 - Containerization: Any containers or containerized applications must be built using approved base images, and all containers must be scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment.

**GRC Team**
 - Compliance Tools: All tools used for governance, risk management, and compliance activities must adhere to regulatory requirements. The GRC Team must ensure that only compliant software is used, and that all usage is documented for audit purposes.

**Blue Team**
 - Defensive Tools: Tools such as SIEM, Wazuh, Nagios, and endpoint protection software must be carefully configured and regularly updated to protect the environment. The Blue Team is responsible for monitoring these tools and ensuring they operate within approved parameters.

**Red Team**
 - Pentesting Applications: All penetration testing tools must be pre-approved and isolated within dedicated VMs. The Red Team must document all activities and ensure that no residual data or tools are left behind after testing.
 - Tool Security: Red Team tools must be securely stored, with access restricted to authorized participants. Any new tools or updates must go through the standard approval process before use.

**Infrastructure Team**
 - Infrastructure Management Tools: All tools used for managing servers, VMs, network devices, and cloud services must be approved and configured securely. The Infrastructure Team is responsible for ensuring that these tools do not introduce vulnerabilities into the environment.
 - Patch Management: The Infrastructure Team must coordinate with the IT Support Team to ensure that all infrastructure-related applications and tools are kept up-to-date and secure.

**Compliance and Auditing**
 - Regular Audits: The Security Team must conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with the Application Control Policy. Audits will include a review of the application whitelist and blacklist, an analysis of logs, and a check for unauthorized software.
 - Policy Violations: Any violation of the Application Control Policy, whether intentional or unintentional, must be reported immediately. Consequences for violations may include restricted access to systems, additional training, or disciplinary action, depending on the severity.
