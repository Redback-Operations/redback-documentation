# Data Analytics Framework

## Introduction

The purpose of this framework is to provide a structured approach to harnessing the power of data in making informed decisions. It serves as a comprehensive guide for Redback Operations project teams to systematically navigate through the complex process of collecting, processing, analysing, and interpreting data. By setting out clear steps and methodologies, this framework ensures that data analytics initiatives are aligned with the overarching goals of Redback Operations, whether they are business-driven objectives or research-oriented inquiries.

The framework acts as a blueprint for consistency and efficiency in handling data. It helps in establishing best practices, ensuring data quality and integrity, and fostering a data-driven culture within the organisation. It also aids in mitigating risks associated with data management, such as data breaches or compliance issues, by embedding necessary protocols and ethical guidelines. Ultimately, this framework aims to empower projects teams to unlock actionable insights from data, leading to more strategic decisions, and enhanced performance in their respective fields.

## 1. Define Objectives and Questions

### Identify the Business or Research Objectives

1. **Understanding the Context**  
   Begin by comprehensively understanding the context in which the data analytics will be applied. This could be a business setting, a research environment, or any other scenario where data is crucial.

2. **Aligning with Redback Operational Goals**  
   Ensure that the objectives of data analytics are aligned with the broader goals of Redback Operations. This alignment guarantees that the outcomes will be relevant and valuable.

3. **Objective Setting**  
   Clearly define what you want to achieve through data analytics. These objectives could range from improving the project performance, predicting certain outcomes, to solving specific research questions.

### Formulate Specific Questions that Data Analytics Can Answer

1. **Breaking Down Objectives into Questions**  
   Translate each objective into one or more specific questions that data analytics can address. For instance, if the objective is to improve runner performance, potential questions could be, "What factors most influence an athleteâ€™s running performance?"

2. **Feasibility and Relevance of Questions**  
   Assess the feasibility of answering these questions with available data. Ensure that the questions are not only answerable but also relevant to the objectives.

3. **SMART Criteria**  
   Apply the SMART criteria to these questions - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This ensures that each question is well-defined and can guide focused analysis.

4. **Prioritising Questions**  
   In cases where multiple questions are identified, prioritise them based on factors like their impact on the objectives, data availability, and the resources required for analysis.

### Collaborative Input

1. **Stakeholder Engagement**  
   Involve key stakeholders in the process of defining objectives and formulating questions. This may include the Project Director, Mentors, Project, and Tech Leads. Their insights can provide valuable perspectives and ensure that the analytics efforts are closely aligned with user needs and expectations.

2. **Feedback Loop**  
   Establish a feedback loop where initial objectives and questions can be refined and iterated upon based on stakeholder input and preliminary findings.

### Documentation and Communication

1. **Clear Documentation**  
   Document the defined objectives and questions clearly. This documentation should be accessible to all team members and stakeholders involved in the data analytics process.

2. **Setting the Foundation for Analytics Work**  
   Use this documentation as a foundational guide for subsequent steps in the data analytics process, ensuring that all efforts are geared towards answering these questions and achieving the set objectives.

## 2. Data Collection

### Establish Methods for Data Collection

1. **Identifying Data Sources**  
   Begin by identifying potential data sources relevant to your objectives and questions. These could include internal sources generated from other projects or external sources like public datasets.

2. **Selection of Data Collection Methods**  
   Choose appropriate data collection methods based on your objectives and the nature of your data. This could range from sourcing data from IoT devices to utilising data mining techniques and APIs for extracting large volumes of quantitative data.
