## Policy Statement
Redback Operations is committed to maintaining the highest standards of cybersecurity. This policy outlines our approach to ensuring all personnel understand their role in safeguarding our systems, data, and infrastructure. We aim to foster a culture of security awareness and compliance through structured, role-appropriate, and regularly updated training.

## Purpose

The purpose of this User Awareness Training document is to define the standards that must be followed for the training and upskilling of our employees. The policy outlines mandatory training modules to guarantee compliance with internal policies and recognized cybersecurity frameworks, such as NIST, the Australian Government ISM, and the Essential Eight.

## Introduction

### What is user awareness training?

User awareness training refers to the guidelines put in place by an organisation to help educate workers about the potential risks of their role and job functions. Though the awareness training typically focuses on data protection, data security and overall compliance with company policies. 

### What is the purpose of user awareness training?

User awareness training serves a range of crucial functions within an organisation. Aside from educating workers about the potential risks of their job functions, it also provides employees with a range of strategies and procedures that they can follow to mitigate or resolve these risks effectively.

Through the provision of this training, not only is data security improved, but if followed correctly, there may be a significant increase in company performance and morale.

Finally, user awareness training works to minimise potential loss, and consequently, it works to foster a safe and positive working environment.

## Why Do We Follow This Training?

We follow our user awareness training as it is put in place to prevent any sort of risks that may present themselves and pose a threat to the company.

### Risks of Non-Compliance

If we did not follow our user awareness training protocols, a collective employee gap in knowledge may leave Redback Operations prone to, and susceptible of a range of attacks.

These attacks can target our sensitive data, company systems, assets, trade secrets and critical infrastructure.

In the event of an attack, if employees haven’t conducted our user awareness training, we may suffer a significant data leak and/or data loss due to a lack in knowledge of how to appropriately respond to or prevent such a thing. This data may be revealed to the public, which will hold a significant impact on the company, and its relationship with consumers, as their information may be susceptible to tampering, unauthorized disclosure, or it may be used against them.

Not only this, but the compromise of our company systems, assets, and critical infrastructure may lead to a complete loss of access, to both, our data, and our recovery systems, causing us to lose everything we have.

### Scope and Applicability

This policy applies to:
- All full-time and part-time employees.
- New hires.
- Contractors and third-party vendors.
- Specific business units such as IT, HR, Compliance, and Marketing.

- HR Department: Track completion rates and initiate disciplinary actions if needed.

## Training Objectives
