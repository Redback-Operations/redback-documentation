### Log Collection Frequency & Retention

#### Log Collection Standards

The following rules apply in relation to Log Collection, Retention & Storage requirements:

-   All systems must transmit logs securely to centralized log management solutions using encrypted channels (TLS 1.2 or higher).
-   Log collection agents must be configured to capture all log entries without filtering, to ensure comprehensive data capture.
-   Logs must be stored in encrypted form using AES-256 encryption to ensure their confidentiality and integrity.
-   Access to logs must be controlled via role-based access controls (RBAC), ensuring that only authorized personnel have access based on their specific roles and needs.
-   Critical systems and security logs are collected in real-time to facilitate immediate analysis and response to potential security threats.
-   Application and system logs are configured to capture data per session or transaction, while network logs are typically collected at regular intervals, adjusted based on traffic volume and risk assessment.

#### Retention Duration

The following rules apply in relation to Retention requirements:

-   Log retention periods are defined based on legal, regulatory, and operational needs. Log retention may extend up to several years based on the sensitivity of the target system.
-   All logs must be retained for a minimum of 12 months, subject to target source criticality. Critical systems such as financial or personally identifiable information (PII) handling systems must retain logs for a minimum of 24 months.
-   Logs must be archived in a secure manner at the end of their active life and must be readily accessible for audit purposes for an additional 12-month post-retirement.

#### Secure Storage and Destruction

Logs are securely stored in encrypted formats with access controls strictly limiting access to authorized personnel only.

**Note:** **Procedures for the secure destruction of data are referenced in the Data Classification & Data Loss Prevention policy within the ISMS. Refer to this policy for further information.**

### Compliance with Standards & Controls

The log management practices defined in this policy align with CIS Controls for effective log management and ISO/IEC 27001 standards for information security management, ensuring data governance and compliance adherence with global cybersecurity industry standards.

By enhancing the log collection practices as outlined, Redback Operations strengthens its cybersecurity framework, ensuring that log management not only meets compliance requirements but also supports proactive security monitoring and incident management effectively. This detailed approach facilitates a secure, compliant, and efficient operational environment.

### Auditing & Review

Compliance audits of log management practices must be conducted **annually** to ensure adherence to this policy and relevant legal or regulatory standards. Audit trails must be maintained for all access and changes to log data, to provide accountability and traceability.

### Documentation and Training

All procedures related to log management must be fully documented and updated annually or following significant changes to the IT environment. Staff involved in log management must receive regular training on their responsibilities under this policy and on the secure handling of log data.

### SIEM/SOC Logging Protection

To ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of log data at Redback Operations, it is critical to implement security measures. Here are the minimum high-level requirements for protecting the integrity of the Redback Operations SIEM/SOC platform:

#### Data Encryption:

-   Utilize strong encryption standards such as AES-256 for log data at rest and TLS for log data in transit to protect against unauthorized access and interception.

**Note: Refer to the Cryptography Policy within the Redback Operations ISMS for further detail.**

#### Access Control:

-   Implement strict access controls using role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized personnel have access to log data.
-   Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for systems accessing log data to add an additional layer of security and adhere to common industry framework controls such as CIS.

#### Log Integrity:

-   Apply cryptographic hashing to log entries to detect and prevent unauthorized changes.
    -   Any alteration of the log data will result in a different hash value, indicating tampering.
-   Use log management solutions that support log immutability (such as write-once-read-many (WORM) storage) to prevent alteration or deletion of log data.

#### Regular Security Assessments:

-   Conduct regular security assessments of the log management infrastructure to identify vulnerabilities.

**Note: Refer to the Attack Surface Management policy referenced in the Redback Operations ISMS for further detail.**

#### Redundancy and Backup:

-   Regularly backup log data to secure, geographically dispersed locations to prevent data loss from local disasters or system failures.

**Note: Refer to Redback Operations Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery Policy for further detail.**

## Policy Review

Regular reviews and timely updates to the Monitoring & Log Analytics Cyber Security Policy are essential for keeping it relevant and effective at Redback Operations.

**Note: Company layout and infrastructure does not reflect the standards outline in this policy at the time of this document’s creation and is considered a long-term strategy to implement when company maturity has improved.**

### Responsibility for Reviews

The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is designated as the primary initiator of the reviews for the cyber security policy at Redback Operations. A review committee assists in evaluating the effectiveness and relevance of the policy.

### Frequency of Reviews

Reviews are scheduled to occur at least annually. However, more frequent reviews are conducted if there are significant changes in technology, business practices, or compliance requirements. Ad-hoc reviews are also permitted in response to security incidents or major failures in the existing policy.

### Proposing and Approving Changes

Any member of the review committee can propose changes during the review process. These proposals should be supported by a rationale and, where possible, data to substantiate the change.
