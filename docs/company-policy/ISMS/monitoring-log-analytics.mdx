### Security Operations Centre (SOC) Activities

#### Real-time Monitoring and Analysis

SOC teams utilize real-time log data to identify and respond to incidents swiftly, employing advanced tools for anomaly detection and threat hunting.

Incident Response and Forensics

The following rules apply to Incident Response & Forensics:

-   Logs should provide crucial evidence and aid in forensic investigations to understand attack vectors and mitigate threats effectively.
-   Real-time log analysis must be conducted for identifying security incidents, operational issues, and compliance anomalies.
-   SIEM systems must be configured to generate alerts based on predefined criteria for critical events such as unauthorized access attempts, system failures, or significant changes to sensitive systems.
-   In the event of security incidents, logs must be used to perform root cause analysis, identify indicators of compromise (IoC) and to aid in remediation efforts.
-   Logs related to any identified incident must be preserved beyond the standard retention period until the incident is fully resolved and closed.

Logs must contribute directly to the triage and escalation of incidents. Alerts generated from log activity must be assigned thresholds that, when triggered, route events to appropriate Incident Response (IR) playbooks. Suppression and tuning mechanisms must be documented and reviewed regularly to avoid alert fatigue and ensure timely response.

Threshold examples include:
- Multiple failed authentication attempts within a 10-minute window.
- Unusual data exfiltration patterns.
- Configuration changes to critical systems outside business hours.

### Log Collection Frequency & Retention

#### Log Collection Standards

The following rules apply in relation to Log Collection, Retention & Storage requirements:

-   All systems must transmit logs securely to centralized log management solutions using encrypted channels (TLS 1.2 or higher).
-   Log collection agents must be configured to capture all log entries without filtering, to ensure comprehensive data capture.
-   Logs must be stored in encrypted form using AES-256 encryption to ensure their confidentiality and integrity.
-   Access to logs must be controlled via role-based access controls (RBAC), ensuring that only authorized personnel have access based on their specific roles and needs.
-   Critical systems and security logs are collected in real-time to facilitate immediate analysis and response to potential security threats.
-   Application and system logs are configured to capture data per session or transaction, while network logs are typically collected at regular intervals, adjusted based on traffic volume and risk assessment.

#### Retention Duration

The following rules apply in relation to Retention requirements:

-   Log retention periods are defined based on legal, regulatory, and operational needs. Log retention may extend up to several years based on the sensitivity of the target system.
-   All logs must be retained for a minimum of 12 months, subject to target source criticality. Critical systems such as financial or personally identifiable information (PII) handling systems must retain logs for a minimum of 24 months.
-   Logs must be archived in a secure manner at the end of their active life and must be readily accessible for audit purposes for an additional 12-month post-retirement.

#### Secure Storage and Destruction

Logs are securely stored in encrypted formats with access controls strictly limiting access to authorized personnel only.

**Note:** **Procedures for the secure destruction of data are referenced in the Data Classification & Data Loss Prevention policy within the ISMS. Refer to this policy for further information.**
