## 1. Level of Preparedness
-   How many devices are running outdated operating systems or software?
-	How are security controls tested for effectiveness and assurance?
-	How are security policies and procedures updated and communicated to students, and how is compliance monitored?
-	How are we managing data classification and data retention policies, and how are those policies enforced?

## 2. Intrusion attempts
-	What is the average time it takes to investigate and respond to detected intrusion attempts?
-	What measures are in place to prevent false positives and false negatives in intrusion detection systems?
-	How many unauthorized access attempts have been detected and blocked by the firewall?

## 3. Security Incidents
-	How is data recovery managed in the event of a security incident, and how are backups tested and validated?
-	How is threat intelligence gathered and used to proactively detect and prevent security incidents?
-	How is Redback Operationsâ€™ incident response plan updated and tested to ensure it remains effective and relevant?

## 4. Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)
-	How long does it take for the team to become aware of security threats and incidents?
-	How are security controls and monitoring tools tuned to improve detection and response times?
-	How are false positives and false negatives addressed in the security monitoring process, and how is this process continually refined?

## 5. Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) 
-	How long does it to respond following immediate awareness of a cyber attack
-	What are the key steps involved in the incident response process, and how are they tracked and measured?
-	How are stakeholders, such as students and staff informed and kept up to date during the incident response process?

## 6. Mean Time to Contain (MTTC) 
-	How long does it take to contain identified internal and third-party attacks across all endpoints and systems from the time of initial detection?
-	How do we measure improvement in the cybersecurity habits of your staff?
-	How do you measure the reduction in incident frequency?

## 7. Access Management
-	How is access to sensitive data and systems controlled and monitored, and how is privilege escalation prevented?
-	Are all accounts secured with Muli-Factor Authentication (MFA)?
-	Do we have a password policy addressing common malpractices, such as password recycling and weak passwords?
