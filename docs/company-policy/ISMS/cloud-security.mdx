## 5. Security Controls

### 5.1 Secure Architecture and Development

1. **Environment Isolation**
   - Use separate Azure subscriptions/resource groups and GCP projects for Production, Test, and Development. Segregate networks into tiered subnets.
2. **Network Controls**
   - Use Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) and GCP VPC firewall rules to whitelist necessary traffic. Protect public endpoints with Azure Application Gateway (WAF) or GCP Cloud Armor.
3. **Hardened Configurations**
   - Use CIS-benchmarked VM images (Azure) or Shielded VMs (GCP). Enforce baseline settings with Azure Policy and GCP Organization Policies.
4. **Infrastructure-as-Code**
   - Provision all resources via ARM/Bicep (Azure) or Terraform/Deployment Manager (GCP). Include policy-as-code checks in CI pipelines.
5. **Design Reviews**
   - Require Security Team approval for significant architecture changes, with formal threat models and mitigations documented.

### 5.2 Identity and Access Management

1. **Centralized Identities**
   - Federate GCP IAM and Azure AD with corporate IdP (SAML/SCIM). Automate account lifecycle management.
2. **MFA Enforcement**
   - Mandate MFA for all user access to portals and CLIs. Configure Azure Conditional Access and Google 2-Step Verification.
3. **Least-Privilege RBAC**
   - Grant narrowly defined roles (e.g., Storage Blob Data Reader) at the most restrictive scope. Avoid Owner/Editor roles.
4. **Privileged Access**
   - Onboard high-privilege users into Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for just-in-time access; manage GCP Org admins with groups and approval workflows.
5. **Account Hygiene**
   - Enforce strong passwords, terminate accounts within 24 hours of departure, and prohibit shared accounts.
6. **IAM Monitoring**
   - Enable and monitor Azure AD sign-in/audit logs and GCP Admin Activity logs. Alert on changes to principal roles.

### 5.3 Data Protection

1. **Classification and Labeling**
   - Tag all cloud data storage by sensitivity tier.
2. **Encryption at Rest**
   - Use platform default encryption; for sensitive data, use Customer-Managed Keys in Azure Key Vault or GCP Cloud KMS (AES-256).
3. **Encryption in Transit**
   - Use Azure Front Door/Load Balancer or GCP HTTPS Load Balancer to enforce TLS 1.2+. Secure internal traffic with mTLS or service mesh.
4. **Key and Secret Management**
   - Store keys/secrets in vault services. Implement segregation of duties, monitor usage, and rotate keys regularly.
5. **Data Loss Prevention**
   - Use DLP tools (Azure Information Protection, GCP DLP) to scan for sensitive data. Restrict public access; use signed URLs/SAS tokens that expire.
6. **Backups and Recovery**
   - Configure daily backups using Azure Backup and GCP snapshots; store in isolated environments. Encrypt backups and enable immutability/soft delete.
7. **Backup Testing and Retention**
   - Test restores every three months. Retain backups for at least 90 days; archive as per compliance needs.

### 5.4 Logging, Monitoring, and Incident Response

1. **Enable Logging**
   - Enable Azure Activity Logs, NSG flow logs, resource diagnostic logs; for GCP, enable Cloud Audit Logs and VPC Flow Logs.
2. **Centralized Repository**
   - Aggregate logs into Azure Monitor/Log Analytics or GCP Cloud Logging; retain 90 days online, 1 year archived.
3. **Real-Time Alerts**
   - Use Azure Defender for Cloud, Azure Sentinel, GCP Security Command Centre, or Cloud Monitoring for policy violation and anomaly alerts.
4. **Continuous Compliance Checks**
   - Enforce via Azure Policy initiatives and GCP Organization Policies; report compliance weekly.
5. **Incident Response Integration**
   - Route notifications to Redback’s IR process; maintain runbooks for common cloud incidents (e.g., exposed storage, compromised credentials).
6. **Metrics and Reporting**
   - Track misconfigurations, remediation times, incidents, and backup success rates. Report monthly dashboards to leadership.

### 5.5 Vulnerability Management & Patching

1. **OS and Host Patching**
   - Schedule monthly patching using Azure Update Management and GCP OS Config. Apply critical patches within 48 hours.
2. **Application and Dependency Updates**
   - Use managed PaaS services for automated patching. Scan containers and libraries for CVEs; redeploy/rebuild when patched.
3. **Service Versioning**
   - Track versions of managed services (AKS, GKE) and upgrade before end-of-support. Automate updates where possible.
4. **Emergency Patch Process**
   - Maintain out-of-band processes for zero-day exploits; use compensating controls as needed.
5. **Verification and Audits**
   - Implement automated reporting and quarterly manual checks for patch compliance.

### 5.6 Third-Party Integrations

1. **Vendor Assessment**
   - Conduct security questionnaires and verify certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001) before integration.
2. **Access Control**
   - Grant time-limited, least-privilege access via service principals or guest accounts with MFA.
3. **API Security**
   - Store credentials in vaults; enforce OAuth 2.0 or signed request patterns. Limit scopes to required API operations.
4. **Marketplace and Open-Source Software**
   - Use validated Azure Marketplace and GCP Marketplace solutions. Scan and validate open-source software.
5. **Shared Responsibility**
   - Document security responsibilities between Redback and vendors. Include obligations in contracts and SLAs.
6. **Compliance Requirements**
   - Require vendors to meet encryption and logging standards; reserve the right to audit their controls.

## 6. Compliance and Governance

### 6.1 Framework Alignment
Controls map to NIST CSF functions—Identify (asset inventory, roles), Protect (IAM, encryption, patching), Detect (logging, monitoring), Respond (incident management), Recover (backups)—and cover all eight ASD Essential Eight mitigations.

### 6.2 Monitoring and Audits
- **Automated Checks**: Enforce significant controls via Azure Policy and GCP Organization Policies.
- **Quarterly Audits**: Security/GRC team audits IAM, encryption, network, and backup settings; record findings in the risk register with remediation plans.

### 6.3 Exceptions
- **Formal Exception Process**: Document business justification, compensating controls, and duration. Obtain Security/GRC approval.
- **Periodic Review**: Revisit exceptions every six months to assess ongoing need.

### 6.4 Training and Awareness
- **Onboarding and Annual Refreshers**: Mandatory training on cloud security and controls.
- **Ongoing Updates**: Share lessons learned, new functionality, and threat advisories.

### 6.5 Reporting and Metrics
- **Monthly Dashboards**: Report vulnerabilities found, remediation times, incident counts, and backup success rates to IT management.
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Present cloud security posture to the Risk Committee.

### 6.6 Policy Maintenance
- **Annual Review**: Revise policy for significant cloud architecture changes or new threats.
- **Version Control**: Track changes in history and communicate updates to stakeholders.

### 6.7 Enforcement
- **Mandatory Compliance**: Non-compliance may lead to revocation of privileges, disciplinary action, or termination per HR policy.
- **Remediation Focus**: Honest errors are addressed through coaching; deliberate violations face strict action.
