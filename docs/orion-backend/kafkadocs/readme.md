 ## Testing Face Detection

1. Send a test message

- Use the /send endpoint to publish a test message to Kafka
    Example :
```bash
  {
  "content": "process_image",
  "sender": "test_client"
  }
```

2. Process an image

  - Place test images in your project directory
```bash
from model import detect_faces
results = detect_faces("path/to/image.jpg")
print(results)
```

3. Retreive processed images

- Use the /receive endpoint to get messages from the Kafka consumer.

 ## Monitoring 

- Check your terminal or logs for Kafka consumer output

- PostgreSQL stores all processed face detection results — use tools like pgAdmin or psql CLI to inspect stored data

# Kafka Core Concepts

## Kafka Architecture Overview

Kafka operates as a distributed messaging system that follows a client-server architecture. Applications connect to Kafka brokers via configuration settings:

```python
bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092'
```
**This setting establishes the fundamental connection between client applications and the Kafka cluster, serving as the entry point for all communications. The cluster maintains topics that organize message streams, while clients interact with these topics through well-defined APIs.**


The Kafka broker handles message persistence, replication, and delivery, functioning as an intermediary between producers and consumers while maintaining highly available service.

### Producer-Consumer Model

The implementation demonstrates Kafka's producer-consumer model through specialized components:

**Producers**
Producers are applications that publish messages to specific topics. The code shows multiple producer implementations:

- `A video frame producer that extracts and sends face detection data`
- `A media stream producer that publishes encoded audio and video chunks`
- `A messaging producer that sends chat data`
```python
producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')
)
producer.send(topic, result)
```

**Consumers**
Consumers subscribe to topics and process published messages. Different consumer implementations demonstrate varying consumption patterns:

- `A face data consumer that processes detection results and stores them in a database`
- `A video consumer that reconstructs frames from received data`
- `A threaded consumer within a web application that maintains an in-memory queue`

```python
consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'Faces',
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    auto_offset_reset='earliest',
    value_deserializer=lambda v: json.loads(v.decode('utf-8'))
)

for msg in consumer:
    data = msg.value
    # Process the message
```
This decoupled architecture enables independent development, deployment, and scaling of producers and consumers.

## Topics and Partitions

This decoupled architecture enables independent development, deployment, and scaling of producers and consumers.

```python
# Different topics for different data domains
'Faces'        # Face detection data
'chat'         # Messaging data
'media-stream' # Video and audio streaming data
```
Topics are physically implemented as partitions, providing the foundation for parallelism and distributed processing. While partitioning configuration is not explicitly shown in the code, the Kafka client libraries manage the distribution of messages across partitions when multiple partitions exist.


Messages with the same key are guaranteed to be sent to the same partition, enabling ordering guarantees for related messages.

## Message Delivery Semantics

The implementation demonstrates various delivery semantics through configuration options:

```python
# Different offset reset strategies
auto_offset_reset='earliest'  # Process all available messages
auto_offset_reset='latest'    # Process only new messages
```

```python
# Ensuring message delivery
producer.flush()  # Blocks until messages are sent
```
```python
# Managing consumer offsets
enable_auto_commit=True  # Automatically track processed messages
```
These settings control the reliability guarantees:
- At-most-once: When producers don't wait for acknowledgments
- At-least-once: When producers confirm delivery and consumers track offsets
- Exactly-once: Requires additional configuration using transactions and idempotent producers

The implementation primarily uses at-least-once semantics, ensuring messages are never lost while accepting the possibility of duplicate processing.

## Getting Started
This section guides you through the practical steps to begin using Kafka in your application.

## Basic Setup

Before creating producers and consumers, you need to set up a basic Kafka environment:

```python
# Import the required libraries
from kafka import KafkaProducer, KafkaConsumer
import json

# Define broker connection information
KAFKA_BROKER = 'localhost:9092'
TOPIC_NAME = 'example-topic'
```
Make sure your Kafka broker is running and accessible at the specified address before proceeding to the next steps.

## Simple Producer Example
The following example demonstrates how to create a basic producer that sends messages to a Kafka topic:

```python
# Create a Kafka producer with JSON serialization
producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers=KAFKA_BROKER,
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')
)

# Send a message to the topic
message = {"key": "value", "timestamp": "2023-04-09T12:00:00Z"}
producer.send(TOPIC_NAME, message)

# Ensure the message is sent before continuing
producer.flush()

print("Message sent successfully!")
```
This producer serializes Python dictionaries to JSON before sending them to the Kafka topic.

## Simple Consumer Example
Here's how to create a basic consumer that reads messages from a Kafka topic:

```python
# Create a Kafka consumer with JSON deserialization
consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    TOPIC_NAME,
    bootstrap_servers=KAFKA_BROKER,
    auto_offset_reset='earliest',
    value_deserializer=lambda v: json.loads(v.decode('utf-8'))
)

# Process messages
print("Waiting for messages...")
for message in consumer:
    data = message.value
    print(f"Received: {data}")
    
    # Process the message data here
    
    # To exit the loop (in this example), break after processing one message
    break

consumer.close()
```
This consumer deserializes JSON messages back into Python dictionaries and processes them one by one.

## Configuration Options
Kafka clients offer numerous configuration options to customize behavior:

```python
producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8'),
    acks='all',                # Wait for all replicas to acknowledge
    retries=3,                 # Number of retries if the broker is unavailable
    batch_size=16384,          # Size of batches in bytes
    linger_ms=10,              # Delay in milliseconds to allow batching
    compression_type='gzip',   # Message compression type
    max_in_flight_requests_per_connection=1  # For strict ordering
)
```
**Consumer Configuration**
```python
consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'example-topic',
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    group_id='my-group',          # Consumer group ID
    auto_offset_reset='earliest',  # Start from beginning of topic
    enable_auto_commit=True,      # Automatically commit offsets
    auto_commit_interval_ms=5000, # Commit interval in milliseconds
    fetch_max_bytes=52428800,     # Max bytes to fetch per request
    max_poll_records=500,         # Max records per poll
    value_deserializer=lambda v: json.loads(v.decode('utf-8'))
)
```
These configurations allow you to fine-tune performance, reliability, and behavior of your Kafka applications.

## API Reference
###  Producer API

**Module**: `producer.py`  
**Functionality**:
- Reads video frames using OpenCV.
- Applies YOLOv3-based face detection.
- Sends JSON results to the Kafka topic `Faces`.

**Kafka Configuration**:
```python
KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')
)
```

Topic: Faces
Message Format:
```json
{
  "frame_id": 12,
  "total_faces": 3,
  "faces": [
    {
      "face_id": 0,
      "bounding_box": {"x": 100, "y": 120, "width": 50, "height": 50},
      "confidence": 0.89
    }
  ]
}

```

### Consumer API
**Module**: `consumer.py`  
Functionality:

- Subscribes to Kafka topic Faces.

- Deserializes JSON messages.

- Persists face data to PostgreSQL using insert_face_data().

```python
KafkaConsumer(
    'Faces',
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    auto_offset_reset='earliest',
    value_deserializer=lambda v: json.loads(v.decode('utf-8'))
)
```

PostgreSQL Integration:

- Assumes insert_face_data(data) in database.py.
---
##  Advanced Usage 

###  Serialization and Deserialization

- The **Producer** converts Python data (dictionary) to JSON before sending to Kafka.
- The **Consumer** reads the JSON from Kafka and turns it back into a Python dictionary.

```python
# Producer
value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')

# Consumer
value_deserializer=lambda v: json.loads(v.decode('utf-8'))
```

---

###  Error Handling and Retry Mechanism

- Right now, the app stops with `CTRL+C`.
- In the future, we try to implement:
  - **Retry logic**: Try sending or saving again if something fails.
  - **Logging errors**: Print or save errors to understand what went wrong.

---

###  Performance Tuning

- You can skip more frames by changing this line in `producer.py`:
  ```python
  frame_interval = int(fps / 3)
  ```
  Try `/2` or `/5` depending on how fast you want it.

- Use **batch writes** for PostgreSQL to save many face results at once.
- Kafka has settings like `linger.ms` and `batch.size` to send data faster and smarter.

---
##  Monitoring and Metrics

Monitoring helps ensure your system is working correctly, and lets you catch problems early. Below are suggestions to monitor the health and performance of your Kafka pipeline.

---

###  Kafka Monitoring

Use tools like:

- **Kafka Manager** or **Confluent Control Center** – to monitor:
  - Topic lag
  - Message throughput
  - Broker health
- **Prometheus + Grafana** (with JMX Exporter) – for real-time dashboards

**Metrics to track**:
- `Messages In/Out per second`
- `Under-replicated partitions`
- `Consumer group lag`
- `Producer retries/failures`

---

###  Producer Metrics

If you want to log metrics from the `producer.py`, consider:

- Logging each frame sent and face count:
  ```python
  print(f" Sent Frame {frame_id}: {result['total_faces']} faces")
  ```
Track dropped frames, retries, or exceptions using a logger.

For more advanced tracking:

- Use **prometheus_client** Python package to expose metrics from producer and consumer as HTTP endpoints.

### Consumer Metrics
**Monitor**:

- Number of messages consumed

- Insert success/failure count in PostgreSQL

To add basic timing:
```python
import time
start_time = time.time()
insert_face_data(data)
print(f"Insertion took {time.time() - start_time} seconds")
```

### PostgreSQL Monitoring
Used tools like pgAdmin, PostgreSQL Performance Dashboard, or command-line utilities (e.g., pg_stat_statements) to:

Track query execution times

Monitor CPU and memory usage

Review indexing effectiveness and query plans

  
# Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to deploy the Kafka-based face detection system using Docker Compose.

---

## Production Best Practices

### Recommendations
- Use environment variables via `.env` for configuration.
- Separate dev/staging/prod Docker files if needed.
- Never commit actual secrets (e.g., passwords, keys) to version control.
- Use logging, retry, and error handling in producer/consumer scripts.
- Monitor Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Airflow health with dashboards or alerts.

---

### Scaling Considerations

### Techniques
- Use Kafka **partitions** to parallelize topic processing.
- Add more **consumers** in a **consumer group** to scale reads.
- Use multiple **Airflow Celery workers** for concurrent DAG execution.
- Enable **PostgreSQL partitioning or table sharding** for handling large volumes of face detection data.
- Control processing load using `frame_interval` in `producer.py`.

###  How It Works

- Use Airflow DAGs to:
  - Periodically scan folders for `.mp4` files
  - Trigger face detection
  - Store results in PostgreSQL  or export as CSV

Example DAG task:
```python
run_producer = BashOperator(
    task_id='process_video',
    bash_command='python /opt/airflow/dags/producer.py'
)
```

---

## Stream Processing

###  Real-Time Analytics

- Connect the producer to a **live video source** (RTSP camera or webcam).
- Use Kafka to stream frames with minimal latency.
- Consumers process in near-real-time and store results in PostgreSQL.
- Combine with Airflow for post-processing pipelines or alerts.

#  Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sumituiet/kafka_python/
cd face-detection-kafka
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file using `.env.example` as a reference.

5. Run services:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

---

##  Code Style Guidelines

- Follow **PEP8** for Python code.
- Use meaningful variable names and comments.
- Use `black` or `autopep8` for formatting:
```bash
black .
```

- Follow consistent naming and indentation conventions.

---

##  Testing

- Unit tests should go in the `tests/` folder.
- Use `pytest` to run tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

- Each function/module should have at least one test case.

---

#  Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you resolve common issues and understand how to debug problems in the Kafka-based face detection system.

---

##  Common Issues

### 1. Kafka Producer not connecting
**Symptoms**: `NoBrokersAvailable` or connection timeout

**Solutions**:
- Ensure Kafka is running (`docker compose ps`)
- Check that you're using the correct port (usually `9092` or `29092`)
- Ensure environment variables in `.env` are correct

---

### 2.PostgreSQL insertion fails
**Symptoms**: Connection refused, timeout, or no data appears in PostgreSQL

**Solutions**:

- Ensure PostgreSQL service is running (check with systemctl status postgresql or using Redback monitoring tools)

- Verify that insert_face_data() (or your database utility function) connects to the correct host, port, username, password, and database name

- Use psql CLI or pgAdmin to manually connect and verify if data is being inserted:

```bash
psql -h <host> -U <user> -d <database>
```

---

### 3. Airflow web UI is blank or errors
**Solutions**:
- Check Airflow logs using `docker compose logs airflow`
- Ensure `FERNET_KEY` is set and consistent across all services
- Run `airflow db upgrade` and restart services

---

##  Debugging Tips

- Use `print()` logs or structured logging (`logging`, `loguru`) in `producer.py` and `consumer.py`
- Enable Prometheus metrics and visualize with Grafana
- Use `docker logs <container>` to inspect container output
- Temporarily reduce `frame_interval` to speed up testing

---

##  FAQ

### Q: Can I run this without Docker?
**A**: Yes, but it's not recommended unless necessary. Since all services (Kafka, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Airflow) are already hosted on the Redback server, you only need to:

- Set up a local Python environment (uv venv recommended)

-Ensure your scripts connect to the Redback-hosted service URLs and ports

- Manually install Python dependencies (e.g., kafka-python, psycopg2, requests, etc.)
### Q: How do I connect to Kafka UI?
**A**: Visit `http://redback.it.deakin.edu.au:8080 `— Kafka UI is hosted and running on the Redback server.

 If you're running it locally instead, the URL would be http://localhost:8080.

### Q: What is the use of `frame_interval`?
**A**: It controls how frequently frames are processed. Higher values = fewer frames.

### Q: How do I add another consumer?
**A**: Clone `consumer.py`, give it a unique group ID, and run it in parallel.

### Q: How can I scale this in production?
**A**: 
- Use Kafka partitions to parallelize message processing

- Deploy microservices with Kubernetes or Cloud Run

- Use a managed PostgreSQL service like Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or Supabase

- Monitor performance using Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog
