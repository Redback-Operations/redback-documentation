# New Repositories

:::info

**When might it be appropriate to create a new repository?**

- You are creating a new shared library that will be used across multiple projects.
- A website/app is being decommissioned and replaced.

:::

If project leaders and the company web dev leader(s) agree there is a genuine need for a new web app, it should be created by forking the [template repository](https://github.com/Redback-Operations/redback-frontend-web-template) within the Redback GitHub organisation. 

For a shared library, it may be more appropriate to start from scratch but copy the structure, tools, and processes of the other codebases. 

All new repositories should be created in the [Redback Operations GitHub organisation](../../../onboarding/github/github-org-guide.md) in the first instance, **not** in personal accounts. This needs to be done by a project leader, company leader, mentor, or experienced student with "membership" of the org.
