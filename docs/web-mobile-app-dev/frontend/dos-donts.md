# Dos and don'ts

## Common mistakes and how to avoid them

### Where to do your work

<table>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" style={{"text-align":"left","min-width":"12rem"}}>Mistake</th>
        <td>![Error](./img/icon-error.svg) Creating your own repository and start creating a website/app from scratch.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" style={{"text-align":"left"}}>Why it's a mistake</th>
        <td>![Explanation](./img/icon-info.svg) These are team projects designed to be handed over and worked on by multiple capstone cohorts across trimesters. Multiple students creating new websites/apps from scratch means dupicated work, reduced collaboration, and inconsistency that negatively impacts our projects' longevity.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" style={{"text-align":"left"}}>What to do instead</th>
        <td>![Correct action](./img/icon-success.svg) Fork the existing repositories for the project(s) you need to work on to your own GitHub account. </td>
    </tr>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" style={{"text-align":"left","min-width":"12rem"}}>Mistake</th>
        <td>![Error](./img/icon-error.svg) Assuming you cannot work on a company repo if you can't create a branch, so not doing any work or starting a new website/app from scratch.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" style={{"text-align":"left"}}>Why it's a mistake</th>
        <td>![Explanation](./img/icon-info.svg) For ease of admin across trimesters, direct write access is limited to project leaders, mentors, and selected students who are experienced with Git and/or leading specific pieces of work.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" style={{"text-align":"left"}}>What to do instead</th>
        <td>![Correct action](./img/icon-success.svg) Fork the repository and create a branch in your fork for each piece of work.</td>
    </tr>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" style={{"text-align":"left","min-width":"12rem"}}>Mistake</th>
        <td>![Error](./img/icon-error.svg) Adding a new folder with a separate React app to a repository.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" style={{"text-align":"left"}}>Why it's a mistake</th>
        <td>![Explanation](./img/icon-info.svg) This is a team project. We are all working on the same app(s), and for separation of concerns and effective collaboration there must only be one app in each repository.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" style={{"text-align":"left"}}>What to do instead</th>
        <td>![Correct action](./img/icon-success.svg) Follow the guides in this documentation website to set up and begin work on the app that has already been set up.</td>
    </tr>

### How to submit your work

<table>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" style={{"text-align":"left","min-width":"12rem"}}>Mistake</th>
        <td>![Error](./img/icon-error.svg) Sending code to project leaders or mentors directly.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" style={{"text-align":"left"}}>Why it's a mistake</th>
        <td>![Explanation](./img/icon-info.svg) This is an impractical way to review code and provide feedback. Plus, all code submissions need to go through the pull request process regardless of any conversations that go on through other channels.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" style={{"text-align":"left"}}>What to do instead</th>
        <td>![Correct action](./img/icon-success.svg) Raise a pull request to have your code reviewed. If it is a work-in progress you want feedback on, you can mark the PR as a draft and note in the title/description that it's a work-in-progress. Please see the [Submitting Code](./submitting-work) page for more information.</td>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" style={{"text-align":"left","min-width":"12rem"}}>Mistake</th>
        <td>![Error](./img/icon-error.svg) Raising a pull request in the template repository, when it should be raised in a team project repository.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" style={{"text-align":"left"}}>Why it's a mistake</th>
        <td>![Explanation](./img/icon-info.svg) It is important to raise pull requests in the correct repository so that the right people are notified and the right people can review your code. Because the team project repositories are forked from the template, if you follow the link shown in your terminal after you push your commit to go to GitHub and raise a PR, it may have that as the target. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" style={{"text-align":"left"}}>What to do instead</th>
        <td>![Correct action](./img/icon-success.svg) In that pull request creation screen, check the target and ensure your project repository is selected, not the template.</td>
    </tr>
