# Troubleshooting

## Can't push branch

### I get a "fatal: empty ident name not allowed" error in my terminal, or a 403 error in my GUI.

Please contact your project leader to ensure you have been added as a collaborator with write access to the repository. Alternatively, fork the repo and work on your fork instead.

### I get the error remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.

Cache your credentials using the instructions in this article: [Caching your GitHub credentials in Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git).

Tip: If you are using Linux or WSL, using the CLI is a super easy way to do this:
1. `sudo apt install gh`
2. `gh auth login`
3. Follow the prompts to authenticate with your GitHub account
4. Profit.
