### Wearable Swim Stroke Analyser Specifications

**Description:**
This device is a compact, wearable device designed for swimmers to wear on their hands. It provides detailed feedback on the force and direction of their swim strokes, as well as mapping the stroke shape through accelerometry. This device aims to help swimmers optimize their technique and performance in the water.

**Key Features:**

1. **Force and Pressure Sensors:**
   - Measures the magnitude and direction of force exerted during each stroke.
   - Utilizes pressure sensors embedded across the palm and finger regions of a glove- or hand paddle like wearable.

2. **Accelerometers:**
   - Dual-axis accelerometers to accurately capture the 3D motion and shape of each stroke.
   - Helps in analyzing stroke efficiency and form.

3. **Design:**
   - Lightweight, waterproof silicone material for minimal interference with natural swimming motions.
   - Flexible and durable to withstand various swimming conditions.
   - Adjustable straps to ensure a snug fit for different hand sizes.

4. **Data Transmission:**
   - Wireless real-time data transmission to a linked smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth since the device itself is unlikely to have capability to store significant amounts of data.
   - Ideally compatible with iOS and Android devices through a dedicated app.

5. **Data Analysis Software:**
   - Provides feedback on stroke power and form.
   - Visualizes stroke dynamics with 3D animations to aid in technique improvement.
   - Allows for session-by-session tracking to monitor progress.

6. **Battery and Charging:**
   - Rechargeable battery would need to support at least 90 minutes continuous swimming and would ideally support up to 6 hours.
   - USB-C charging cable for easy and fast charging.

7. **Additional Features:**
   - Waterproof up to 50 meters.
   - Ambient temperature sensor to adjust readings based on water temperature as this may impact on force and speed.

**Applications:**
- Suitable for competitive swimmers, swimming coaches, and swim training programs.
- Can be used in pools, open water, and controlled training environments.
