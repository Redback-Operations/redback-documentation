# Aerodynamic Bike Resistance Monitor Specifications

## Description

This device is designed to attach to the front of a bicycle, aimed at estimating aerodynamic resistance. It integrates with speed, power, and incline measurements to help cyclists and coaches assess the aerodynamic efficiency of different riding positions and equipment setups.

## Key Features

1. **Air Flow Sensors:**
   - High-sensitivity sensors measure the flow and velocity of air around the front of the bike to estimate aerodynamic drag.
   - Able to detect subtle changes in air resistance caused by different bike setups and rider positions.

2. **Integration with Bike Computers:**
   - Connects seamlessly with existing bike computers and sensors for speed, power, and incline data.
   - Uses combined data to calculate and display an estimate of the coefficient of drag area (CdA).

3. **Mounting System:**
   - Easy-to-install mounting bracket designed to securely attach to a variety of bike front sections.
   - Aerodynamically shaped to minimize its own impact on resistance measurements.

4. **Wireless Connectivity:**
   - Bluetooth (and possibly ANT+) compatibility for wireless data transmission to other cycling devices and smartphones.
   - Enables post-ride analysis through a dedicated mobile app or compatible bike computers.
   - Could eventually allow for real-time aerodynamic feedback during rides.

5. **Data Analysis and Feedback:**
   - Algorithms provide insights into how different riding positions or equipment affect aerodynamic drag.
   - Allows for A/B testing of gear and positioning to find the most aerodynamically efficient setup.

6. **Power Supply:**
   - Powered by a rechargeable battery with at least 2 hours of runtime and ideally up to 10 hours.
   - USB-C charging port for quick and convenient charging.

8. **Durability and Resistance:**
   - Robust, waterproof construction ensures functionality in all weather conditions.
   - Impact-resistant materials protect the device during falls or rough rides would be ideal as long as they do not conflict with the other requirements by making the device too bulky or inconvenient.

## Applications

- Ideal for road cyclists, triathletes, and cycling teams focused on performance optimization.
- Useful in both training and competitive environments, particularly in time trials and triathlons where aerodynamics play a crucial role.
