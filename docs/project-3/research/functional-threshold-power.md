# Functional Threshold Power

# Introduction

If you're interested in developing tools to assist cyclists in improving their performance, you've likely come across the term "FTP" or Functional Threshold Power. FTP is a pivotal metric within the cycling community that allows you to assess a cyclist's fitness level, establish accurate training zones, and create tools tailored to enhancing their strength and efficiency. Understanding FTP is crucial when building effective resources for cyclists looking to excel in their sport.

# What is FTP?

Functional Threshold Power, abbreviated as FTP, is a crucial measure of a cyclist's fitness and endurance. It represents the maximum power output you can sustain for an hour-long effort without going into an anaerobic state (where your muscles produce more lactic acid than they can clear). In simpler terms, it's the power level you can maintain during a tough, hour-long ride.

## Why is FTP Important?

FTP serves as a foundational metric for several key aspects of your cycling training:

1.  **Training Zones**: FTP helps establish training zones based on individual fitness level. These zones guide workouts, ensuring that training is at the right intensity to stimulate improvements in aerobic capacity and endurance.
    
2.  **Progress Tracking**: Tracking changes in FTP over time can help assess the effectiveness of a training program. An increase in FTP indicates improved fitness and performance.
    
3.  **Race Pacing**: Knowing FTP allows setting of appropriate pacing strategies for races and long rides. It enables avoiding burning out early by staying within a sustainable power range.
    
4.  **Customized Workouts**: With FTP in hand, you can tailor workouts to match fitness level, ensuring each session is challenging but achievable.
    

## How to Determine Your FTP

There are several methods to determine FTP:

1.  **Functional Threshold Power Test**: The most accurate way to determine your FTP is by performing a dedicated FTP test. This typically involves a 20-minute all-out effort, followed by a calculation to estimate FTP based on the power output during that effort. Commonly used platforms for these include such as [Zwift](http://www.zwift.com/) and [TrainerRoad](http://www.trainerroad.com/) but they can easily be performed without a platform on any bike that has a power metre. This would also be an excellent candidate for adding to the Redback Operations virtual riding platform.
    
2.  **Power Metre**: If you have a power metre on your bike, it can continuously measure power output, making it easier to track FTP without a formal test. Various training platforms and apps can estimate your FTP based on power data and this project has implemented a predictive model to accurately estimate FTP based of sub-maximal training workouts.
    
3.  **FTP Ramp Test**: Some cycling software platforms offer ramp tests that gradually increase the resistance or power output until the cyclist can no longer maintain the prescribed pace. These tests can provide an estimate of FTP.
