# Heart Rate Zones

This document provides information on heart rate zones to support sports performance analysis.

## Heart Rate Zones

Heart rate zones are ranges of the heart which, usually expressed as a percentage of your maximum heart rate, that correspond to different levels of exercise intensity. These ranges are used to guide training and exercise intensity for various fitness goals. Heart rate ranges are generally classified into the following zones.

**Zone 1 - Light Intensity (50-60% of Max Heart Rate)**

This zone is ideal for warming up or cooling down and is a great zone to stay in for recovery workouts. Exercising in this zone helps improve overall health and can help beginners start their fitness journey.

**Zone 2 - Moderate Intensity (60-70% if Max Heart Rate)**

This zone is generally used for endurance training and helps improve aerobic capacity and endurance. In this zone, it is expected you can perform exercises for longer periods, which is great for runners and cyclists.

**Zone 3 - Aerobic/Tempo Intensity (70-80% of Max Heart Rate)**

Training in this zone can help improve the efficiency the blood circulation and strengthening the cardiovascular system.

**Zone 4 - Anaerobic Threshold (80-90% of Max Heart Rate)**

Training in this zone can help improve your lactate threshold, which increases your ability to perform at higher intensities for longer. It is highly effectives for improving speed and muscle strength.

**Zone 5 - Maximum Effort (90-100% of Max Heart Rate)**

This is the highest intensity zone and involves short bursts of maximum effort exercises. This zone is typically activated during interval training and is used for improving maximum speed and power.

## Maximum Heart Rate

A general rule to calculate your maximum heart rate (MHR) is by subtracting your age from 220. For example, for a 30-year-old, their MHR would be:

220 - 30 = 190 beats per minute
