## Introduction
This document provides a brief overview of the objective, rationale, and methodology for developing a secure email infrastructure at Redback Operations. As Redback Operations has no existing domain and email infrastructure, this project focuses on implementing a robust, scalable, and secure email infrastructure to support the company’s operational and cybersecurity requirements. This project initiative aligns with Redback Operations’ mission of innovation, quality management, and security excellence.

---

## Project Background, Objectives and Justification

### Project Background
Redback Operations currently lacks an email infrastructure. As a result, it presents operational challenges which are outlined below:

1. **Communication Inefficiency**:  
     Challenges in establishing professional communication channels with stakeholders, clients, and team members.

2. **Susceptible to Security Threats**:  
     The absence of a domain-specific email infrastructure increases the exposure and attack surface to security threats such as phishing, spoofing, and BEC (Business Email Compromise).

3. **Lack of Scalability**:  
     The absence of a secure and centralized email infrastructure limits the company’s ability to:
     - Support future growth
     - Seamlessly integrate with the company’s systems, projects, and teams
     - Establish a centralized security administration for managing email identities and security policies.

---

## Project Objectives
The major objective of this project is to address the challenges listed above, and as a result, enable secure communication, improve operational efficiency, and safeguard the company against email-based threats. This is achieved through the following:

1. Establishment of a Secure Email Infrastructure  
2. Implementation of Email Security Protocols  
3. Implementation of Industry-Standard Security Controls (e.g., CIS Benchmarks)  
4. Enhancement of Scalability and Security  
5. Development of Comprehensive Documentation  

To support the achievement of the project objectives, **Microsoft 365 Exchange Online** was chosen as the preferred platform based on the following criteria:  
1.	Advanced security features, compliance, and governance capabilities.  
2.	Scalability features to support future growth and integration with the company’s other systems.  
3.	Support for advanced security capabilities and email authentication protocols such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.  
4.	High availability is supported by Microsoft’s global infrastructure.

## Alternatives  
Before proceeding with this project initiative of implementing a secure infrastructure using Microsoft 365 and GoDaddy, alternative solutions were explored to address the communication and security needs of Redback Operations. The alternatives explored are outlined below:  
### 1.	Alternative 1: Use Free Email Services (e.g., Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo)  
**Description:** Utilize free email services such as Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo to create email accounts for Redback Operations.  

**Advantages:**  
•	Zero initial setup cost.  
•	Easy to create and configure email accounts without requiring any specialized knowledge.  

**Disadvantages:**  
•	Lacks credibility and professionalism due to generic domains (eg: blueteam-redbackops@gmail.com).  
•	Limited options for advanced configuration, customization, and security features compared to enterprise-grade solutions.  
•	No provision for centralized administration of email identities and security policies.  

**Conclusion:** This alternative was not selected due to limitations in scalability, security, and brand alignment.  

### 2.	Alternative 2: Self-Hosted Email Server  
Description: Set up an on-premises email server within Redback Operations’ on-premises infrastructure.  

**Advantages:**  
•	Full control over email infrastructure and security configurations.  
•	No dependency on third-party providers.

**Disadvantages:**  
•	Requires an existing robust on-premises infrastructure, and likely incurs significant upfront implementation and ongoing maintenance efforts and costs.  
•	Requires dedicated resources – in terms of infrastructure and personnel.  
•	High risk of outages and downtime without proper redundancy mechanisms.  

**Conclusion:** This alternative was not selected due to the lack of an existing robust on-premises infrastructure at Redback Operations, as well as the significant cost and efforts required for implementation and maintenance.

## Methodology

### Phase 1 – Domain Registration & Email Infrastructure Setup
#### 1. Domain Registration
1.1. Register a new domain (e.g., `redbackops.com`) with a secure and reputable registrar.  
1.2. Enable domain security features such as **Domain Privacy** and **Domain Lock**.

#### 2. Email Service Provider (ESP) Setup
2.1. Research and select an ESP.  
2.2. Set up email infrastructure by configuring the selected ESP with the registered domain.  
2.3. Create initial email accounts (e.g., `admin@redbackops.com`).

### Phase 2 – Initial Email Setup and DNS Configuration
#### 3. DNS Configuration & Validation
3.1. Configure DNS records:  
     - Add a TXT record to verify domain ownership.  
     - Add an MX record to route emails to the domain.  
     - Add a CNAME record to configure email settings for users automatically.  
     - Add a TXT record to configure SPF.  
     - Add CNAME records to configure DKIM.  
     - Add a TXT record to configure DMARC.

3.2. Validate DNS propagation:  
     - Use online tools such as **MXToolbox** and **Dmarcian**.  
     - Use command-line tools such as `nslookup`.

### Phase 3 – SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Implementation
#### 4. Security Controls Implementation & Validation
4.1. Implement fundamental email authentication protocols:  
     - Configure SPF  
     - Enable DKIM  
     - Implement DMARC:
          - Configure DMARC policy  
          - Configure DMARC monitoring and reporting using Valimail

4.2. Validate email authentication protocols:  
     - Use online tools such as **MXToolbox**, **Dmarcian**.  
     - Use command-line tools such as `nslookup`.

### Phase 4 – Additional security controls based on the CIS Foundations Benchmark guidelines
4.3. Implement additional security controls based on **CIS Foundations Benchmark** guidelines:  
     - Anti-phishing Policy  
     - Anti-spam Policy  
     - Anti-malware Policy  
     - Safe Attachments Policy  
     - Safe Links Policy  
     - Content Filtering Policy  
     - Common Attachment Types Filtering Policy  
     - Connection Filtering Policy  
     - Alert Policies  

4.4. Validate using the recommended audit guidelines per the **CIS Foundations Benchmark**.  

## Phase 5 – Additional Security Controls
4.5.  Implement the use of mail transport rules to maintain a list of IoC and blocked senders list and reject emails from those IoC and blocked sender sources.  
4.6.  Validate by adding a test sender address and IP address to the blocked senders list and confirming that the emails are blocked when sent from the listed sender address and IP address.  

4.7.  Enforce **Strict TLS encryption** instead of Opportunistic TLS for all email transmissions to ensure data confidentiality and integrity during transport.  
4.8.  Validate **Strict TLS encryption** by checking email headers and ensuring TLS is enforced.  

4.9.  Enforce **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for email accounts.  
4.10. Validate MFA is enabled by attempting to log in and verifying that the second authentication step is prompted.  

4.11. Implement geofencing for email access.  
4.12. Validate by attempting email access from an unauthorized location and ensuring access is blocked.  

4.13. Implement email activity logging and auditing.  
4.14. Validate by reviewing logs and ensuring that email activities are captured.  

4.15. Implement email retention and **DLP (Data Loss Protection)** policies.  
4.16. Validate by attempting to delete sensitive emails and confirming that the policies prevent unauthorized deletion or sharing.
