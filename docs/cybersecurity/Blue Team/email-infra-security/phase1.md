## Objective
The objective of this phase is to establish the foundational components for the implementation of a secure email infrastructure for Redback Operations. This phase focuses on:

1. **Domain Registration**: Securing a domain for Redback Operations.  
2. **Email Service Provider (ESP) Setup**: Setting up an Email Service Provider (ESP) with initial configurations.

## Deliverables
1. A registered domain.  
2. A selected Email Service Provider (ESP).

## 1. Domain Registration
Outlined below are the steps undertaken for Domain Registration:

### 1.1. Domain Registration
#### 1.1.1. Select a domain name:  
For this project, the selected domain name is – `redbackops.com`.

> Initially, the domain name `redbackops.com.au` was considered, but registering a `.com.au` or `.net.au` domain requires the customer to:  
> - Be a commercial entity  
> - Have either an Australian Company Number (ACN) or Australian Business Number (ABN)

#### 1.1.2. Select a reputable domain registrar:  
For this project, the selected registrar is – **GoDaddy**.

#### 1.1.3. Register the domain:  
Register the domain with the chosen registrar (**GoDaddy**).

## 2. Email Service Provider (ESP) Selection

### 2.1 Research and Select an ESP
#### 2.1.1. Select an Email Service Provider (ESP):  
For this project, the selected email service provider is – **Microsoft 365 Exchange Online**.

#### 2.1.2. Criteria for the ESP Selection:  
1. Advanced security features, compliance, and governance capabilities.  
2. Scalability features to support future growth and integration with the company’s other systems.  
3. Support for advanced security capabilities and email authentication protocols such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.  
4. High availability is supported by Microsoft’s global infrastructure.

---

### 2.2. Set up Email Infrastructure by Configuring the Selected ESP
#### 2.2.1. Setup Process:  
For this project, the **Microsoft 365 Developer Program** was used to set up the M365 Exchange Online email infrastructure.

#### 2.2.2. Program Sign-Up:  
Sign up for the **Microsoft 365 Developer Program** for the project implementation.

> **Note**: For this project, the ‘Instant sandbox’ option was chosen for quick setup. However, it is recommended to go with the ‘Configurable sandbox’ option.  
> - If you select a configurable sandbox, you can customize your domain name.  
> - You will have an empty sandbox that you must populate with sample data.  
> - The provisioning of the ‘Configurable sandbox’ may take up to two days.

---

### 2.3. Create an Initial Email Account
#### 2.3.1. Create Account:  
Create an initial email account (e.g., `adm-redbackops@redbackops.com`) as part of the Microsoft 365 Developer Program sign-up process.
