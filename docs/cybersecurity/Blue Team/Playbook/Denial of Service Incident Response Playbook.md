## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

Denial of Service (DoS) assaults are a serious threat to the availability and integrity of online services in today's interconnected digital ecosystem. A denial-of-service (DoS) attack attempts to stop a system, network, or service from operating normally by flooding it with excessive amounts of unauthorized traffic or resource requests. These assaults have the potential to cause downtime, monetary losses, reputational harm, and even jeopardize the privacy of confidential data.

### 1.2 Purpose

This Denial of Service (DoS) Incident Response Playbook aims to offer a thorough structure for identifying, preparing, and responding to DoS attacks. This playbook tries to protect vital assets and services from disruptive cyber threats and reduce the effect of DoS incidents on our organization's operations by providing preventive measures, detection methods, response protocols, and recovery plans.

### 1.3 Attack Definition

An attempt to bring down a computer or network and prevent its intended users from using it is known as a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. DoS attacks achieve this by transmitting information that causes a crash or by overloading the target with traffic. The denial of service or resource to legitimate users, such as employees, members, or account holders, is the result of a denial-of-service attack in both cases.

### 1.4 Scope

This playbook includes a thorough method for handling Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in the operating environment and infrastructure of our company. From pre-incident planning and detection to mitigation, recovery, and post-event review, it covers every stage of incident handling. The principles and processes described in this playbook can be applied to mitigate related threats, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, even if the primary focus of attack is DoS.

## 2 Attack Types

### 2.1 UDP Flood

Attackers using UDP floods make use of UDP's intrinsic simplicity—that is, its connectionless nature, in contrast to TCP. Attackers frequently target ports or services as they bombard the target system with a massive volume of UDP packets. When the target's network bandwidth is overloaded or its processing power is depleted by the flood of UDP packets, it stops responding to legitimate traffic. Because UDP does not ensure delivery or order, attackers can fake the IP addresses used to originate their attacks, making it challenging to identify their origins.

     **Case Study: GitHub DDoS Attack (2018)**
          
     - Overview: The GitHub platform experienced the largest-ever recorded DDoS attack, leveraging Memcached servers to amplify the traffic directed at GitHub's systems.
     - Impact: The attack peaked at 1.35 Tbps, causing temporary disruptions in service.
     - Response: GitHub mitigated the attack using Akamai's DDoS protection services and increased network resilience.


### 2.2 TCP SYN Flood

TCP SYN Flood attacks exploit the Transmission Control Protocol's (TCP) three-way handshake protocol. TCP SYN packets are sent by attackers in enormous quantities; these packets form the initial stage of a TCP connection. They do not, however, send the last ACK packet to complete the handshake, which leaves the target system with a backlog of partially open connections. As a result, valid users are unable to connect to the server because the target's RAM and connection table entries are depleted.

     **Case Study: Mafiaboy DDoS Attack (2000)**

     - Overview: A teenager known as Mafiaboy launched a series of DDoS attacks against major 
websites like Yahoo!, Amazon, and CNN, using TCP SYN floods.
     - Impact: The attacks caused significant disruptions and highlighted vulnerabilities in high-profile websites.
     - Response: The incidents led to increased awareness and improvements in DDoS mitigation strategies.


### 2.3 HTTP Flood

The goal of HTTP flood attacks is to overload web servers with many HTTP requests. Attackers can target URLs, forms, or online application functionalities with a large volume of requests by using botnets or other automated methods. HTTP Flood assaults cause the server's performance to deteriorate, rendering it incapable of responding to valid user requests by using up the server's memory, processing power, and network bandwidth. Consequently, there is a disruption in service or downtime because of the web server becoming slow or unresponsive to authorized users.


     **Case Study: Imperva DDoS Attack (2019)**

      - Overview: A large-scale HTTP flood attack targeted Imperva's infrastructure, using a botnet to generate massive amounts of traffic.
     - Impact: The attack caused temporary service interruptions and highlighted the need for robust application-level defenses.
     - Response: Imperva utilized advanced DDoS mitigation techniques and further enhanced their defences.


### 2.4 Ping Flood (ICMP Flood)

Ping Flood attacks, sometimes referred to as "Ping of Death" or ICMP Flood attacks, overwhelm the target system with an endless barrage of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request packets. These packets, which take advantage of flaws in operating systems or network devices, are sent quickly and are usually larger than the allowed size. The target machine experiences sluggish performance or even crashes because of overusing its CPU and network resources processing these packets. Ping Flood assaults are hard to counter because they might originate from several sources at once and are easy to conduct.

     **Case Study: Smurf Attack (1998)**

     - Overview: The Smurf attack, a type of ICMP flood, targeted multiple organizations, amplifying traffic and directing it towards the victims.
     - Impact: The attack disrupted services and highlighted the vulnerabilities in handling ICMP traffic.
     - Response: Organizations implemented filters and disabled ICMP broadcasts to mitigate the attack.


### 2.5 Slowloris

Attacks known as "slowloris" are named after the way they use server resources—low and slow. Slowloris keeps a small number of connections active for a long time rather than flooding the server with requests. Attackers make sure that every connection is active by sending HTTP headers to the server very slowly. Slowloris stops authentic users from creating new connections by filling the server's connection slots with incomplete requests. A denial- of-service attack against authorized users attempting to access the web server may result from this resource exhaustion approach.

     **Case Study: Iranian Cyber Army Attack (2009)**

     - Overview: In 2009, the Iranian Cyber Army used the Slowloris attack to exploit web server vulnerabilities by keeping connections open with slow HTTP requests. This led to server resource exhaustion and denial-of-service, impacting sites like Twitter and Baidu.
     - Impact: The attack highlighted vulnerabilities in web server handling of persistent connections.
     - Response: Organizations updated their web server configurations to limit the impact of such attacks.


### 2.6 DNS Amplification


DNS Amplification attacks exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers to amplify the volume of traffic directed at the target system. Attackers send small DNS queries with a spoofed source IP address to vulnerable DNS servers, requesting large DNS responses. These responses, which are much larger than the original queries, are directed towards the victim's IP address, overwhelming its network bandwidth. DNS Amplification attacks leverage the inherent trust between DNS servers, making it difficult to trace the origin of the attack.

     **Case Study: Spamhaus DDoS Attack (2013)**

     - Overview: Attackers used DNS amplification to target Spamhaus, a spam-fighting organization, with an attack that peaked at 300 Gbps.
     - Impact: The attack caused significant disruptions to Spamhaus's services and other parts of the internet infrastructure.
     - Response: Spamhaus worked with various ISPs and DDoS protection services to mitigate the attack.


### 2.7 NTP Amplification

NTP amplification attacks are comparable to DNS amplification attacks in that they increase the amount of traffic going to the target system by taking advantage of vulnerable Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers. Attackers make small NTP queries to NTP servers, asking huge NTP answers, using a faked source IP address. The victim's IP address is the target of these replies, which are usually significantly larger than the initial queries and interrupt services by congesting the network. Because the NTP protocol is UDP-based, NTP amplification attacks are challenging to counter.

     **Case Study: Cloudflare DDoS Attack (2014)**
     - Overview: Cloudflare experienced a massive NTP amplification attack that generated traffic exceeding 400Gbps.
     - Impact: The attack caused widespread disruptions and highlighted the need for securing NTP servers.
     - Response: Cloudflare and other organizations implemented measures to secure NTP servers and filter malicious traffic.


### 2.8 Smurf Attack

Smurf Attacks increases the amount of traffic going towards the target system by taking advantage of IP networks' ICMP Echo Reply functionality. A lot of ICMP echo request (ping) packets are sent by attackers to IP broadcast addresses, pretending that the victim's IP address is the originating IP address. As a result, the victim's IP address triggers responses from every computer on the network, exceeding its available bandwidth and resources.

     **Case Study: CERT Smurf Attack (1999)**

     - Overview: The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) was targeted with a Smurf attack, using ICMP echo replies to flood their network.
     - Impact: The attack disrupted CERT's operations and highlighted vulnerabilities in handling broadcast traffic.
     - Response: CERT and other organizations implemented measures to filter and block ICMP echo replies directed at broadcast addresses.


## 3 Stakeholders

- **IT Administration**: The IT administration oversees the organization's servers, networks, and other IT infrastructure. They are essential in identifying, assessing, and minimising a denial-of-service attack in addition to organising the response to the occurrence.
- **Cyber Incident Response Team**: An organization's cyber security incident response team (CSIRT) is a specialised unit tasked with handling security incidents and breaches. Their main objective is to quickly locate, contain, and address issues to lessen their effects. CSIRTs are essential for safeguarding an organization's priceless assets, good name, and customers.
- **External Service Providers**: For a variety of IT services, companies may depend on outside vendors like internet service providers (ISPs), cloud service providers, or managed security service providers (MSSPs). By working together with these suppliers, the company can better respond to the denial-of-service attack and make use of more resources and experience.
- **Technical Support Team**: To troubleshoot and resolve technical issues associated with the DoS attack, the technical support team provides assistance. They can assist in promptly returning regular operations to normal and offer support to end customers impacted by the occurrence.
- **End Users**: If the DoS attack prevents end users from accessing services or apps, it could influence them. Minimising the impact on the position they hold can be achieved by keeping them updated on the situation and offering advice on workarounds or substitute solutions.
- **Senior Management/Executive Leadership**: In deciding how to respond to the DoS attack, senior management, or executive leadership assigns resources, sets strategic direction, and takes choices. They could also be in charge of maintaining the organization's reputation and dealing with outside stakeholders.

## 5 Incident Response Stages

### 5.1 Preparation

- **Objective**: Establish a robust foundation for effective incident response.

- **Key Actions**
    - Risk Assessment: Use thorough risk assessments to find possible DoS vulnerabilities in systems, apps, and network infrastructure. 
    - Creating Cyber Incident Response Plan(CIRP): Make a thorough incident response plan for handling denial-of-service (DoS) incidents. Establish communication routes, escalation protocols, and roles and duties.
    - Resource Allocation: Ensure that the people, equipment, and technologies required to support incident response activities are available. 
    - Training and Awareness: To improve staff members' comprehension of DoS risks, detection methods, and response protocols, offer training and awareness programmes. 
    - Form an Incident Response Team: Assign people to specific areas of handling the response to denial-of-service (DoS) situations in order to create a specialised team.

### 5.2 Detection

- **Objective**: Promptly identify and confirm the occurrence of DoS attacks.

- **Key Actions**
    - Monitoring and Alerting: To identify indications of unusual behaviour suggestive of a denial-of-service attack, continuously monitor network traffic, system performance metrics, and security logs. 
    - Anomaly Detection: Use intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), network traffic analysis tools, and security information and event management (SIEM) systems to identify strange patterns or abrupt increases in traffic volume that could be signs of a denial-of-service assault. 
    - Alert Triage: Set alerts produced by monitoring systems in order of priority and look into them to see whether they point to a possible DoS assault. Correlate alerts with several data sources to validate them.

### 5.3 Analysis

- **Objective**: Conduct in-depth analysis of the DoS attack to understand its nature, scope, and impact.

- **Key Actions**

    - Traffic Analysis: Examine network traffic patterns to determine the nature of the traffic, source IP addresses, and services or apps that are being targeted in order to determine the characteristics of the DoS attack. 
    - Log analysis: Look through firewall logs, system logs, and other pertinent log data to find any unusual activity or attempted illegal access that may have been connected to the DoS incident. 
    - Forensic Investigation: Gather and store digital evidence connected to the DoS assault for forensic examination. Memory dumps, system snapshots, and packet captures are a few examples of this. 
    - Root produce Analysis: Find the vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that the attacker may have exploited in order to trigger the denial of service (DoS) incident.

## 7 Terminology

- **CIRP (Cyber Incident Response Plan)**: It is a documented set of procedures and guidelines for organization to follow when responding to and managing security incidents. It outlines roles, responsibilities, communication channels, and technical steps necessary to detect, analyse, contain, eradicate, and recover from incidents. It is essential to have a well-prepared CIRP for effective incident response and minimizing the impact of security threats.

- **CSIRT (Cyber Security Incident Response Team)**: It an expert group that handles cyber security incidents. They are responsible for detecting, analysing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents affecting an organization. CSIRTs play a critical role in safeguarding an organization’s assets and maintaining trust with stakeholders.

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: It is a communication protocol used for time-sensitive transmissions such as video playback or DNS lookups. It does not establish a connection before data transfer and directly send them to a target computer without checking whether they arrived as intended or indicating their order.

- **TCP three-way handshake**: It is a protocol for establishing a connection between a server and a client in a TCP/IP network. It involves three steps: client sends a SYN segment to the server, server responds with a SYN-ACK segment, client acknowledges the server’s response with an ACK segment and establishing a reliable connection for data transfer.

- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: An attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services.

- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**: A type of DoS attack where multiple compromised systems attack a target, causing a denial of service.

- **Network Traffic Analysis**: The process of intercepting and examining messages to deduce information from patterns in communication.
