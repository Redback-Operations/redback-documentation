## 7. Terminology

 - **Virus Outbreak**: A circumstance in which malicious software quickly spreads throughout the computers, networks, or devices of an organisation, usually with the goal of stealing, interfering with, or breaching data.

 - **Incident Response**: A methodical and organised procedure designed to locate, contain, and lessen the harm a virus outbreak does to an organization's IT infrastructure to minimise interruption and get things back to normal.

 - **Forensic Analysis**: The methodical analysis and assessment of digital data associated with the virus outbreak, such as malware samples, system artefacts, and network logs, to determine the source of the attack, estimate its extent, and supply proof for legal or investigative needs.

 - **Polymorphic Virus**: A kind of virus that is challenging for antivirus software to identify and neutralise as it can alter its appearance or signature with every infection. During virus outbreaks, polymorphic viruses are renowned for their capacity to spread quickly and elude detection by conventional security measures.

 - **Endpoint Security**: A thorough method for protecting mobile, laptop, and desktop computer systems—known as network endpoints—against online dangers including viruses. To prevent virus outbreaks, endpoint security solutions include host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS), antivirus software, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) technologies.

 - **Infection Vector**: The process or avenue via which a virus enters a network or organisation and infects systems. Email attachments, malicious websites, portable media (like USB drives), and software flaws are frequently used as entry points for virus outbreaks.

 - **Cyber Threat Hunting**: Initiative-taking monitoring and scanning of networks and systems for indications of malicious behaviour or possible virus outbreaks. Cyber threat hunting is the process of identifying and eliminating threats before they become widespread viral outbreaks by examining network traffic, system behaviour, and records.
