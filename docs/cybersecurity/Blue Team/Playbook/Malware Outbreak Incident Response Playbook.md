## 1. Introduction

Data integrity, reputation, and company operations are all seriously at danger from malware outbreaks. To reducing harm and guaranteeing business continuity, timely malware incident identification, containment, and mitigation are essential. This playbook offers a systematic approach for managing malware outbreaks, defining roles, duties, and procedures to enable a successful response.

### 1.1 Overview

The incident response playbook for malware outbreaks provides a structured approach to locating, stopping, eliminating, and recovering from attacks by malware. It seeks to expedite reaction efforts and lessen the effect of malware breakouts on organisational assets and stakeholders by creating defined protocols and communication channels.

### 1.2 Purpose

This playbook's goals are to:
 - Provide a uniform procedure for tackling malware outbreaks to guarantee consistency and effectiveness in incident management. 
 - Enable prompt detection and incident containment to stop malware from spreading further and reduce damage.
 - Reduce the impact of malware outbreaks on company operations and lower the financial losses they cause. 
 - During incident response activities, encourage cooperation, coordination, and communication amongst response teams, stakeholders, and other relevant parties.

### 1.3	Attack Definition

Malware is software that is intentionally created to cause harm, interfere with operations, or obtain unauthorised access to data, networks, and computer systems. It includes a wide range of dangers, including as trojans, worms, viruses, ransomware, and spyware. Multiple routes, including portable media, malicious websites, email attachments, and software flaws, can lead to malware epidemics.

### 1.4 Scope

This playbook covers incidents related to malware outbreaks on Redback Operations computers, networks, and endpoints. It addresses both external and internal malware issues that impact stakeholders, data assets, and company processes, requiring an integrated response effort regardless of the type of malware or transmission technique.

## 2. Attack Types

Malware outbreaks may take many different shapes, and responding to each one presents different difficulties for incident response teams. Malware outbreaks are often linked to the following attack types:

### 2.1 Worms

Worms are self-replicating viruses that spread across networks, exploiting security holes to quickly infect connected computers.

Signs of Worm Activity:
 - Unusual network traffic increases.
 - High bandwidth usage due to worm replication.
 - Increased memory or CPU consumption on compromised computers.
 - Unknown files or processes in system logs.
 - Random system restarts or crashes.

     **Case Study: The Morris Worm (1988)**

     - Overview: One of the earliest worms to spread across the internet was the Morris Worm. Robert Tappan Morris was the creator, and it was made available on November 2, 1988.
     - Signs of Activity: Spreading quickly across networked computers, resulting in resource exhaustion-related system slowdown or crashes.
     - Impact: Affected around 6,000 significant Unix computers, or 10% of the internet at the time. It was projected that the worm would cost between $100,000 and $10 million to eradicate.
     - Response: Network security awareness has grown, and CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) was established to deal with these kinds of situations.

### 2.2 Trojans

Trojans pose as trustworthy programmes to fool users into downloading and running malicious code, giving hackers access to compromised systems without authorisation.

Signs of Trojan Infection: 
 - Suspicious applications or processes running in the background.
 - Unauthorized changes to files or system settings.
 - Remote attackers accessing sensitive information or system resources.
 - Unexpected toolbar or application installations.
 - System sluggishness or frequent crashes.

     **Case Study: Zeus Trojan (2007)**

     - Overview: Zeus, sometimes referred to as Zbot, is a Trojan horse malware bundle that operates on Microsoft Windows versions. It was initially discovered in July 2007.
     - Signs of Activity: Unauthorised access to banking information, unauthorised transactions, and keylogging.
     - Impact: Zeus compromised millions of dollars' worth of fraudulent transactions by infecting thousands of machines throughout the globe with malware and stole banking passwords.
     - Response: Law enforcement and security firms worked together to knock down Zeus command-and-control servers and make many arrests.


### 2.3 Ransomware
Ransomware encrypts user files or locks them out of their computers, then demands money to free it or grant access again.

Signs of Ransomware Activity:
 - Files that are inaccessible and have a.locky or.crypt file extension are encrypted. 
 - Appearance of warning messages or ransom notes requesting money to unlock files. 
 - Alteration of file dates or properties through the encryption procedures of ransomware.
 - Unusual patterns of network traffic as the ransomware talks to the servers that govern it. 
 - Existence on compromised systems of ransomware-related artefacts, such as executables or registry entries.

     **Case Study: WannaCry Ransomware Attack (2017)**

     - Overview: WannaCry was a ransomware cryptoworm that targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting data and demanding ransom payments in Bitcoin.
     - Signs of Activity: Files became inaccessible with ".wncry" extensions, and users saw ransom notes demanding payment.
     - Impact: The incident impacted more than 230,000 computers across 150 nations, seriously disrupting businesses like the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom. There were billions to hundreds of millions of dollars in financial losses.
     - Response: The ransomware's propagation was slowed down when a security researcher found a kill switch in its code. Affected companies strengthened their security protocols and put strategies in place for data recovery.

### 2.4 Botnets

Botnets are networks of infected devices under the control of hackers, frequently employed to carry out coordinated assaults or disseminate malware payloads.

Signs of Botnet Infection:
 - Strange outgoing network connections to command-and-control sites made by compromised devices. 
 - Large amounts of harmful or spam emails coming from infected computers. 
 - Botnet activity on compromised devices is causing high CPU or bandwidth utilisation. 
 - The existence of backdoor trojans or remote access programmes that facilitate botnet communication. 
 - Unexpected alterations in system behaviour or performance brought on by botnet activity.

     **Case Study: Mirai Botnet (2016)**

     - Overview: A software known as the Mirai botnet transforms Linux-powered networked devices into remotely controlled bots that may be deployed as components of a larger botnet in extensive network attacks.
     - Signs of Activity: Unusual network traffic patterns, particularly to command-and-control servers, and involvement in large-scale DDoS attacks.
     - Impact: One of the worst DDoS assaults ever launched against DNS provider Dyn was brought on by the Mirai botnet and resulted in extensive disruptions to the internet.
     - Response: Police departments located and detained Mirai's founders. ISPs and security companies collaborated to increase device security and lessen the botnet's effects.

### 2.5 Spyware

Without user agreement, spyware secretly records private user data, gathers it, and sends it to hostile parties.

Signs of Spyware Presence:
 - Unexpected adjustments to the homepage or default search engine in a browser. 
 - Display of inappropriate pop-up advertisements or browser reroutes to unsafe websites. 
 - Existence of toolbars or unusual browser extensions that have been installed without permission.

 - Criminals gaining illegal access to passwords, surfing history, or sensitive information.

     **Case Study: FinFisher/FinSpy (2011)**

     - Overview: Gamma Group sells the surveillance spyware suite FinFisher, also referred to as FinSpy. Several nations have employed it for monitoring reasons.
     - Signs of Activity: Unauthorized access to sensitive data, keystroke logging, and remote surveillance capabilities.
     - Impact: Human rights advocates, journalists, and political dissidents have all been the targets of FinFisher. Devices in more than 30 nations have been found to contain the malware.
     - Response: Human rights groups have brought attention to the use of FinFisher, and cybersecurity companies have created instruments for identifying and eliminating the malware

### 2.6 Adware

Without the user's permission, adware gathers user data for targeted advertising, displays invasive adverts, and reroutes web traffic.

Signs of Adware Infection:
 - Sudden emergence of unwelcome pop-up advertising or banners when browsing the internet.
 - Redirects users who click on links or search results to dubious or harmful websites. 
 - Adware processes causing slow browser speed or frequent crashes. 
 - Altering the main page or preferred search engine in a browser without permission. 
 - Data, database entries, or browser extensions connected to adware being present on compromised machines.

     **Case Study: Fireball Adware (2017)**

     - Overview: Check Point found an adware called Fireball that takes over browsers and transforms them into zombies.
     - Signs of Activity: Browser hijacking, changes to default search engine, and installation of additional adware or potentially unwanted programs.
     - Impact: Over 250 million machines were infected by Fireball globally, mostly because of it being bundled with other free software. It gathered user data and made false advertising money.
     - Response: To identify and get rid of Fireball, security researchers and antivirus software providers developed updates and removal tools. Campaigns were started to inform people about the dangers of bundled software.
