## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

In today’s digitally interconnected landscape, organizations face an ever-growing array of cyber threats, with elevation of privilege attacks standing out as particularly insidious. The Elevation of Privilege Incident Response Playbook serves as a vital tool to equip organizations with the means to effectively counter such threats. By offering a structured approach to incident response, this playbook is designed to fortify organizational resilience against security breaches and safeguard critical assets. Through proactive measures and clear response protocols, it empowers security teams to swiftly detect, contain, and remediate incidents, thereby minimizing potential damage and disruption. Moreover, the playbook serves as a proactive strategy to bolster the organization’s overall security posture and readiness in the face of evolving cyber threats.

### 1.2 Purpose

The primary purpose of the Elevation of Privilege Incident Response Playbook is to empower organizations to respond swiftly and decisively to elevation of privilege attacks. By providing clear guidelines and procedures, the playbook enables security teams to detect, contain, and remediate incidents in a timely manner, thereby minimizing the potential damage and disruption caused. Additionally, the playbook serves as a proactive measure to enhance the organization’s overall security posture and readiness to combat evolving cyber threats.

### 1.3 Attack Definition

An elevation of privilege attack occurs when a malicious actor gains unauthorized access to privileged accounts, systems, or resources within an organization's network. This type of attack typically involves exploiting vulnerabilities in software, misconfigurations, or weaknesses in authentication mechanisms to escalate their level of access beyond what is intended. Examples of elevation of privilege attacks include privilege escalation exploits, credential theft, and lateral movement within the network. By clearly defining these attack vectors, the playbook equips responders with the knowledge to identify and mitigate such threats effectively.

### 1.4 Scope

The Elevation of Privilege Incident Response Playbook covers a wide range of elevation of privilege incidents that may occur within the organization's infrastructure. This includes attacks targeting servers, workstations, cloud environments, and other critical assets. The playbook applies to incidents involving both internal and external threats, encompassing malicious activities perpetrated by insiders, external adversaries, or third-party actors. Clarifying the scope ensures that responders understand the playbook's applicability and can effectively execute response procedures within their designated domain of responsibility.

## 2 Attack Types

### 2.1 Vertical Privilege Escalation

In this, an attacker seeks to elevate their privileges within the same system or application. This typically involves escalating from a lower privilege level (e.g., a standard user) to a higher privilege level (e.g., an administrator or root user) on the same system. Attackers often exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system, applications, or configuration settings to gain elevated privileges. 

 Common techniques for vertical privilege escalation include:

     - Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, or services to gain unauthorized access to higher privilege levels. This can include buffer overflow attacks, input validation vulnerabilities, or insecure configurations that allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
     - Kernel Exploitation: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system kernel to gain root/administrator privileges on the same system. This typically involves exploiting vulnerabilities in kernel-level components such as device drivers or system calls to escalate privileges within the same system.
     - DLL Hijacking (Windows): Exploiting insecure DLL loading mechanisms in Windows applications running on the same system to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This involves planting malicious DLLs in directories searched by vulnerable applications on the same system.
     - File System Manipulation: Manipulating file system permissions, symbolic links, or file attributes within the same system to gain higher privilege levels. This includes modifying file permissions or creating symbolic links to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories within the same system.

     **Case Study: Microsoft Exchange Server Exploit (2021)**

      - Overview: Attackers exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server, allowing them to elevate privileges and gain access to email accounts and install additional malware.
      - Impact: Hundreds of thousands of servers were compromised worldwide, affecting both private and public sector organizations.
      - Response: Microsoft released patches to address the vulnerabilities, and organizations were urged to apply these patches immediately and review their systems for signs of compromise.


### 2.2 Horizontal Privilege Escalation

Horizontal privilege escalation involves gaining access to the same level of privileges but on a different system or application within the same network environment. This is often referred to as an account takeover. Instead of escalating to a higher privilege level, attackers aim to access resources or data that they are not authorized to access within their current privilege level. This type of attack is often associated with lateral movement within a network, where attackers exploit vulnerabilities or weaknesses in interconnected systems to move laterally and gain access to additional resources.

 Common techniques for horizontal privilege escalation include:

     - Exploiting Weak Authentication: Leveraging weak or default credentials or authentication bypass vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to accounts or systems on other systems within the same network. For example, using compromised credentials to gain unauthorized access to accounts on other systems.
     - Abusing Misconfigured Permissions: Exploiting misconfigured file system permissions or access control settings to gain unauthorized access to resources or data on other systems within the same network. This involves manipulating file permissions or access control settings to access sensitive resources on other systems.
     - Privilege Escalation via Services: Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in network services running on other systems within the same network to gain higher privilege levels. For instance, exploiting vulnerabilities in network services to gain administrative access to other systems.

Understanding the nuances between vertical and horizontal privilege escalation empowers organizations to customize the security defences and response strategies, effectively mitigating the distinct risks posed by each type of attack.

     **Case Study: SolarWinds Cyberattack (2020)**

      - Overview: Attackers inserted malicious code into the SolarWinds Orion platform, enabling them to move laterally within networks and gain access to sensitive information.
      - Impact: The breach affected numerous organizations, including government agencies and private companies, leading to significant data breaches and security concerns.
      - Response: SolarWinds released updates to secure their platform, and affected organizations conducted thorough investigations and applied security measures to prevent further unauthorized access.


### 2.3 Credential Theft

Attackers steal user credentials such as usernames and passwords, often using techniques like phishing, keylogging, or exploiting weak password policies. These stolen credentials are then used to access systems and escalate privileges.

 Common Techniques:

     - Phishing: Deceptive emails or messages trick users into disclosing their credentials.
     - Keylogging: Malicious software records keystrokes to capture login information.
     - Brute Force Attacks: Automated attempts to guess passwords by trying numerous combinations.

     **Case Study: Uber Data Breach (2016)**

     - Overview: Attackers used stolen credentials to access Uber's GitHub repository and obtain sensitive data, including personal information of drivers and riders.
     - Impact: Personal information of 57 million drivers and riders was exposed.
     - Response: Uber implemented stronger access controls, enhanced monitoring, and improved security practices to prevent future breaches.


### 2.4 Lateral Movement

After gaining initial access, attackers move laterally within the network to access additional systems and data. This is often done to maintain persistence and escalate privileges further.

 Common Techniques:

     - Pass-the-Hash: Using hashed credentials to authenticate without knowing the actual password.
     - Exploiting Trust Relationships: Leveraging legitimate network connections to move between systems.
     - Using Exploited Accounts: Compromising additional user accounts to access more resources.

     **Case Study: NotPetya Ransomware Attack (2017)**

      - Overview: The NotPetya ransomware spread laterally within networks, encrypting data and disrupting operations.
     - Impact: The attack caused extensive damage to various organizations, including Maersk and Merck, leading to billions of dollars in losses.
     - Response: Organizations improved their network segmentation, applied patches, and enhanced their incident response capabilities to mitigate the effects of similar attacks in the future.


### 2.5 Insecure API Usage

Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in application programming interfaces (APIs) to gain elevated privileges. APIs that are not properly secured can be used to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.

 Common Techniques:

     - Parameter Tampering: Manipulating parameters sent to APIs to bypass authentication or authorization controls.
     - Injection Attacks: Exploiting injection vulnerabilities in API endpoints to execute malicious code.
     - Excessive Data Exposure: Accessing sensitive data that is inadvertently exposed through poorly designed APIs.

     **Case Study: Facebook API Exploit (2018)**

      - Overview: Attackers exploited vulnerabilities in Facebook's APIs, allowing them to gain access to user accounts and steal personal data.
      - Impact: The breach affected millions of users, exposing their personal information.
      - Response: Facebook patched the vulnerabilities, conducted a thorough security review, and improved their API security practices.
