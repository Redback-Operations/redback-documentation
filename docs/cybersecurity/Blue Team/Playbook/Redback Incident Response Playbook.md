## 7. Terminology

 - **Incident**: Any event that threatens the security, integrity, or availability of Redback Operations' systems, networks, or data.

 - **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Monitors network traffic for signs of malicious activity, unauthorized access, or security breaches.

 - **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Provides real-time visibility into security incidents by aggregating and analysing security event data from multiple sources.

 - **Vulnerability**: A weakness or flaw in software, hardware, or processes that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or cause damage.

 - **Phishing**: A technique used by attackers to deceive individuals into divulging sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, by posing as a trustworthy entity.

 - **Ransomware**: Malicious software that encrypts files or systems, rendering them inaccessible until a ransom is paid.

 - **Forensic Analysis**: The process of collecting, preserving, and analysing digital evidence to investigate and respond to security incidents.

 - **Containment**: Actions taken to limit the spread and impact of a security incident.

 - **Eradication**: The process of removing threats and vulnerabilities from systems after a security incident.

 - **Recovery**: Actions taken to restore normal operations and ensure data integrity after a security incident.

 - **Post-Incident Review**: A structured review and analysis of the response to a security incident to identify lessons learned, areas for improvement, and corrective actions.

 - **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: A methodical investigation process used to determine the underlying cause or causes of a security incident.

 - **Least Privilege Principle**: The security principle that users, processes, and systems should be granted only the minimum level of access or permissions necessary to perform their intended tasks.

 - **Credential Theft**: The unauthorized acquisition of user credentials, such as usernames and passwords, often used to facilitate further attacks or unauthorized access.

 - **Lateral Movement**: The process of moving within a network to access additional systems and data after gaining initial access.

 - **Privilege Escalation**: The act of increasing the level of access or permissions granted to a user or application, typically to gain unauthorized control over system resources or sensitive data.

 - **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities**: Previously unknown security holes in software or systems that leave organizations exposed to exploitation by malicious actors.
