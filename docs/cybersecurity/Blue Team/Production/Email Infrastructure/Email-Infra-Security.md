## Introduction
This document provides a brief overview of the objective, rationale, and methodology for developing a secure email infrastructure at Redback Operations. As Redback Operations has no existing domain and email infrastructure, this project focuses on implementing a robust, scalable, and secure email infrastructure to support the company’s operational and cybersecurity requirements. This project initiative aligns with Redback Operations’ mission of innovation, quality management, and security excellence.

---

## Project Background, Objectives and Justification

### Project Background
Redback Operations currently lacks an email infrastructure. As a result, it presents operational challenges which are outlined below:

1. **Communication Inefficiency**:  
     Challenges in establishing professional communication channels with stakeholders, clients, and team members.

2. **Susceptible to Security Threats**:  
     The absence of a domain-specific email infrastructure increases the exposure and attack surface to security threats such as phishing, spoofing, and BEC (Business Email Compromise).

3. **Lack of Scalability**:  
     The absence of a secure and centralized email infrastructure limits the company’s ability to:
     - Support future growth
     - Seamlessly integrate with the company’s systems, projects, and teams
     - Establish a centralized security administration for managing email identities and security policies.

---

## Project Objectives
The major objective of this project is to address the challenges listed above, and as a result, enable secure communication, improve operational efficiency, and safeguard the company against email-based threats. This is achieved through the following:

1. Establishment of a Secure Email Infrastructure  
2. Implementation of Email Security Protocols  
3. Implementation of Industry-Standard Security Controls (e.g., CIS Benchmarks)  
4. Enhancement of Scalability and Security  
5. Development of Comprehensive Documentation  

To support the achievement of the project objectives, **Microsoft 365 Exchange Online** was chosen as the preferred platform based on the following criteria:  
1.	Advanced security features, compliance, and governance capabilities.  
2.	Scalability features to support future growth and integration with the company’s other systems.  
3.	Support for advanced security capabilities and email authentication protocols such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.  
4.	High availability is supported by Microsoft’s global infrastructure.

## Alternatives  
Before proceeding with this project initiative of implementing a secure infrastructure using Microsoft 365 and GoDaddy, alternative solutions were explored to address the communication and security needs of Redback Operations. The alternatives explored are outlined below:  
### 1.	Alternative 1: Use Free Email Services (e.g., Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo)  
**Description:** Utilize free email services such as Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo to create email accounts for Redback Operations.  

**Advantages:**  
•	Zero initial setup cost.  
•	Easy to create and configure email accounts without requiring any specialized knowledge.  

**Disadvantages:**  
•	Lacks credibility and professionalism due to generic domains (eg: blueteam-redbackops@gmail.com).  
•	Limited options for advanced configuration, customization, and security features compared to enterprise-grade solutions.  
•	No provision for centralized administration of email identities and security policies.  

**Conclusion:** This alternative was not selected due to limitations in scalability, security, and brand alignment.  

### 2.	Alternative 2: Self-Hosted Email Server  
Description: Set up an on-premises email server within Redback Operations’ on-premises infrastructure.  

**Advantages:**  
•	Full control over email infrastructure and security configurations.  
•	No dependency on third-party providers.

**Disadvantages:**  
•	Requires an existing robust on-premises infrastructure, and likely incurs significant upfront implementation and ongoing maintenance efforts and costs.  
•	Requires dedicated resources – in terms of infrastructure and personnel.  
•	High risk of outages and downtime without proper redundancy mechanisms.  

**Conclusion:** This alternative was not selected due to the lack of an existing robust on-premises infrastructure at Redback Operations, as well as the significant cost and efforts required for implementation and maintenance.

## Methodology

### Phase 1 – Domain Registration & Email Infrastructure Setup
#### 1. Domain Registration

1.2. Enable domain security features such as **Domain Privacy** and **Domain Lock**.

#### 2. Email Service Provider (ESP) Setup
2.1. Research and select an ESP.  
2.2. Set up email infrastructure by configuring the selected ESP.  
2.3. Create an initial email account (e.g., `adm-redbackops@redbackops.com).

### Phase 2 – Initial Email Setup and DNS Configuration  
#### 3. Email Infrastructure Setup  
3.1.	Set up email infrastructure by configuring the selected ESP with the registered domain.

#### 4. DNS Configuration & Validation
4.1. Configure DNS records:  
4.1.1. Add a TXT record to verify domain ownership.  
4.1.2. Add an MX record to route emails to the domain.  
4.1.3. Add a CNAME record to configure email settings for users automatically.  
4.1.4. Add a TXT record to configure SPF.  
4.1.5. Add CNAME records to configure DKIM.  
4.1.6. Add a TXT record to configure DMARC.  

#### 5. DNS Propagation Validation:  
5.1. Using online tools such as **MXToolbox** and **Dmarcian**.  
5.2. Using command-line tools such as `nslookup`.  

#### 6. New E-mail Identities/Users Creation  
6.1.	Create the initial batch of new e-mail identities/users for Redback Operations.  

### Phase 3 – SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Implementation
