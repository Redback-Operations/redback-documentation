## Overview
This technical guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to safely upgrade the Wazuh Agent to the latest version, ensuring alignment with other Wazuh components – Dashboard, Indexer, and Manager.

## Prerequisites
1. A Wazuh agent installed on the Docker host.
2. Admin/Root access to the Wazuh Docker host (Linux server).
3. Familiarity with docker, docker-compose, and basic Linux operations.

## Important Note
If the `docker-compose` command does not work on your system, use `docker compose` instead (without a hyphen).

## Upgrade Steps

### Step 1: Install the GPG Key

1. Download the key  
   ```bash
   curl -O https://packages.wazuh.com/key/GPG-KEY-WAZUH
   ```

2. Import the key  
   ```bash
   sudo gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/wazuh.gpg --import GPG-KEY-WAZUH
   ```

3. Fix permissions  
   ```bash
   sudo chmod 644 /usr/share/keyrings/wazuh.gpg
   ```

### Step 2: Add the Wazuh Repository

   ```bash
   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/wazuh.gpg] https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/apt/ stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wazuh.list
   ```
   ![Add Wazuh Repo](./img-agent-upgrade/2_add-wazuh-repo.jpg)

---

### Step 3: Update Wazuh Agent to the Latest Version

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install wazuh-agent
   ```
   ![Update Wazuh Agent](./img-agent-upgrade/3_update-waazuh-agent-latest-version.jpg)<br/>
   ![Update Wazuh Agent](./img-agent-upgrade/4_update-waazuh-agent-latest-version.jpg)

---

### Step 4: Disable Wazuh Repo (to prevent auto-upgrades)

After the upgrade, disable the Wazuh repository to avoid undesired upgrades and compatibility issues and ensure version alignment with the Wazuh Manager component.

   ```bash
   sudo sed -i "s/^deb/#deb/" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wazuh.list
   sudo apt-get update
   ```
   ![Disable Wazuh Repo](./img-agent-upgrade/5_disable-wazuh-repo.jpg)

---

### Step 5: Restart Wazuh API Services

1. Access the Wazuh Manager container:  
   ```bash
   docker exec -it --user root single-node-wazuh.manager-1 bash
   ```
   ![Wazuh Manager Bash](./img-agent-upgrade/6_wazuh-manager-bash.jpg)

2. Restart all Wazuh services in Wazuh manager-1:  
   ```bash
   /var/ossec/bin/wazuh-control restart
   ```
   ![Restart Wazuh Services](./img-agent-upgrade/7_wazuh-manager-services-restart.jpg)

3. Verify the service status:  
   ```bash
   /var/ossec/bin/wazuh-control status
   ```
   ![Service Status](./img-agent-upgrade/8_wazuh-manager-services-status.jpg)

4. Review API logs for issues (if necessary):  
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log
   ```
   ![API Logs](./img-agent-upgrade/9_check-api-logs.jpg)

### Step 6: Restart and Validate Running

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart wazuh-agent
   sudo systemctl status wazuh-agent
   ```

   ✅ Look for:  
   ```
   Active: active (running)
   ```
   ![Restart Agent](./img-agent-upgrade/10_restart-wazuh-validate-running.jpg)

---

### Step 7: Post-Upgrade Validation

1. Log in to the Wazuh dashboard via a browser.  
2. Navigate to: **Agents → Manage Agents**  
3. Confirm the following:
   - The agent is listed.
   - The agent status is shown as `ACTIVE`.
   - The version matches the upgraded version (e.g., `4.11.2`).
   
   ![Verify Upgrade](./img-agent-upgrade/11_verify-wazuh-successful-upgrade.jpg)

✅ This confirms a successful upgrade and validates registration, version alignment, and heartbeat communication with the Wazuh Manager.
