# Redback server - Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (Focal Fossa)

## Running as Root
All steps require running as root. To become root, simply run:

### Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo -i
```

All commands from this point onwards will be as root.
 
## Prerequisites

### Ubuntu 20.04:
```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y autoconf gcc libc6 make wget unzip apache2 apache2-utils php libgd-dev
apt-get install openssl libssl-dev
```

---

## Downloading the Source

```bash
cd /tmp
wget -O nagioscore.tar.gz https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/archive/nagios-4.4.14.tar.gz
tar xzf nagioscore.tar.gz
```

---

## Compile
```bash
cd /tmp/nagioscore-nagios-4.4.14/
./configure --with-httpd-conf=/etc/apache2/sites-enabled
make all
```

---

## Create User and Group
This creates the `nagios` user and group. The `www-data` user is also added to the `nagios` group.

```bash
make install-groups-users
usermod -a -G nagios www-data
```

---

## Install Binaries
This step installs the binary files, CGIs, and HTML files.

```bash
make install
```

---

## Install Service/Daemon
This installs the service/daemon files and configures them to start on boot.

```bash
make install-daemoninit
```

---

## Install Command Mode
This installs and configures the external command file.

```bash
make install-commandmode
```

---

## Install Configuration Files
This installs the *SAMPLE* configuration files, required to start Nagios.

```bash
make install-config
```

---

## Install Apache Config Files
This installs the Apache web server configuration files and configures the Apache settings.

```bash
make install-webconf
a2enmod rewrite
a2enmod cgi
```

---

## Configure Firewall
Allow port 80 inbound traffic on the local firewall for Nagios Core web interface access.

```bash
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j ACCEPT
apt-get install -y iptables-persistent
```

Answer `yes` to saving existing rules.

---

## Create `nagiosadmin` User Account
You'll need to create an Apache user account to log into Nagios. The following command will create a user account called `nagiosadmin`:

```bash
htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin
```

When adding additional users, remove `-c` from the command to avoid replacing the existing `nagiosadmin` user.

---

## Start Apache Web Server
Restart the Apache server after making the changes.

```bash
systemctl restart apache2.service
```

---

## Start Nagios Service/Daemon
Start the Nagios service.

```bash
systemctl start nagios.service
```

---

## Test Nagios
Nagios is now running. To confirm, log into the Nagios Web Interface by pointing your browser to the IP address or FQDN of your Nagios Core server:

```plaintext
http://10.25.5.143/nagios
http://core-013.domain.local/nagios
```

Use `nagiosadmin` as the username and the password (password = 123) you provided earlier.

---

## Installing Nagios Plugins
Nagios Core needs plugins to operate properly. Follow these steps to install Nagios Plugins.

### Prerequisites
Install the required packages:

```bash
apt-get install -y autoconf gcc libc6 libmcrypt-dev make libssl-dev wget bc gawk dc build-essential snmp libnet-snmp-perl gettext
```

---

### Downloading the Source

```bash
cd /tmp
wget --no-check-certificate -O nagios-plugins.tar.gz https://github.com/nagios-plugins/nagios-plugins/archive/release-2.4.6.tar.gz
tar zxf nagios-plugins.tar.gz
```

---

### Compile and Install
```bash
cd /tmp/nagios-plugins-release-2.4.6/
./tools/setup
./configure
make
make install
```

---

## Test Plugins
Point your browser to the Nagios Core server:

```plaintext
http://10.25.5.143/nagios
http://core-013.domain.local/nagios
```

Go to a host or service object and "Re-schedule the next check" under the Commands menu. The previous error should now disappear and the correct output will appear.

---

## Service/Daemon Commands

### Ubuntu:
```bash
systemctl start nagios.service
systemctl stop nagios.service
systemctl restart nagios.service
systemctl status nagios.service
```

---

## Network Configuration for Nagios and IoT Devices

Place the Nagios server and IoT devices on the same network to enable seamless communication. Ensure that the network supports the MQTT protocol for data exchange between the IoT devices and Nagios.

**Figure 1: Port configuration for Nagios**

Since there is another service running on port 80, change that to port 443 in order to run Nagios and create another Apache instance to access Nagios.
