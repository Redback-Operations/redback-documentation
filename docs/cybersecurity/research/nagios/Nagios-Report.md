### Nagios Plugins
## check-mqtt

A [Nagios/Icinga](https://icinga.com/) plugin for checking connectivity to an [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) broker. Or with `--readonly` monitor an MQTT application. Or for checking the status of MQTT clients maintaining the status on an MQTT broker.

This plugin connects to the specified broker and subscribes to a topic. Upon successful subscription, a message is published to said topic, and the plugin expects to receive that payload within `max_wait` seconds.

- **Custom Plugins for MQTT:**

  - **MQTT Monitoring:** Custom plugins can be developed or existing ones configured to monitor MQTT brokers, ensuring they are running correctly and handling message traffic efficiently.
  - **Topic Monitoring:** Plugins can monitor specific MQTT topics, checking message rates and payload content to ensure data integrity and timely delivery.

- **Plugins for IoT Devices:**

  - **Device Status Monitoring:** Plugins to monitor the status and health of IoT devices, ensuring they are online and functioning as expected.
  - **Sensor Data Monitoring:** Plugins to check sensor readings from devices, ensuring data is within expected ranges and identifying potential issues early.
  - **Custom Integrations:** Development of custom plugins to interface with specific IoT devices, enabling tailored monitoring solutions.

- **Compatibility with Existing Infrastructure:**

  - **Wazuh Integration:** Plugins to forward Nagios alerts to Wazuh for a centralized security event management solution.
  - **Suricata Integration:** Ensuring compatibility with Suricata for enhanced network traffic analysis.
  - **PowerBI Integration:** Potential for plugins that format and forward Nagios data to PowerBI for advanced data visualization.

### System Requirements

- **Supported Operating Systems:**

  - **Linux Distributions:** Nagios is compatible with various Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

- **Hardware Requirements:**

  - **CPU:** Minimum of a dual-core CPU, though more powerful CPUs are recommended for larger installations.
  - **Memory:** At least 1 GB of RAM, though 2 GB or more is recommended for larger environments with numerous monitored hosts and services.
  - **Storage:** A minimum of 20 GB of disk space, with additional space needed for storing logs and performance data.

- **Software Dependencies:**

  - **Web Server:** Nagios requires a web server such as Apache or Nginx for its web interface.
  - **Database:** While not mandatory, using a database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL can enhance performance and data handling.
  - **Libraries and Packages:** Dependencies include common libraries such as GCC, GD library, and development tools for compiling plugins and additional features.

## 3. Compatibility and Integration

### IoT Device Integration

1. **Method for Monitoring:**

   - **REST APIs:**  
     Many IoT devices expose REST APIs for status and data retrieval. Nagios can use these APIs to fetch data periodically.

     Custom scripts can be developed to interact with these APIs, retrieve necessary metrics, and feed them into Nagios for monitoring and alerting.

   - **Custom Scripts:**  
     Scripts can be tailored to query specific endpoints or devices, parse the responses, and provide formatted data to Nagios.

     These scripts can be scheduled via cron jobs or integrated directly into Nagios checks to run at specified intervals.

2. **Frequency of Data Collection:**

   - **Timely Updates:**  
     The data collection frequency depends on the criticality of the monitored metrics. High-priority data (e.g., device health) might be collected every minute, whereas less critical data (e.g., temperature) could be collected less frequently.

     Configurable intervals in Nagios allow for setting the optimal frequency for each check, balancing network load and data freshness.

3. **Data Points to be Monitored:**

   - **Temperature:** Monitors temperature readings to ensure devices operate within safe limits, preventing overheating.
   - **Humidity:** Tracks humidity levels to maintain optimal environmental conditions for devices.
   - **Device Status:** Checks the operational status (online/offline) of devices, providing immediate alerts if any device becomes unresponsive.
   - **Performance Metrics:** Additional data points like battery level, signal strength, and sensor-specific metrics to ensure comprehensive monitoring.

### MQTT Integration

1. **Monitoring MQTT Broker Health:**

   - **Uptime:** Ensures the MQTT broker is continuously running without unexpected downtimes.
   - **Active Connections:** Monitors the number of active connections to the broker, detecting anomalies or connection spikes that could indicate issues.
   - **Message Rates:** Tracks the rate of messages being published and subscribed to, ensuring the broker handles the expected load efficiently.

2. **Monitoring MQTT Topics and Payloads:**

   - **Topic Tracking:** Monitors specific MQTT topics for message flow, ensuring data is published and subscribed to as expected.
   - **Payload Analysis:** Inspects message payloads to validate data integrity and correctness, identifying potential issues or data anomalies.

3. **Handling of MQTT QoS and Retained Messages:**

   - **QoS Levels:** Manages different QoS levels (0, 1, 2) to ensure reliable message delivery based on the application's requirements.
   - **Retained Messages:** Handles retained messages to provide persistent data availability, ensuring new subscribers receive the latest message on a topic.

### Security Considerations

1. **Secure Communication:**

   - **Encryption:** Uses TLS to encrypt data in transit between Nagios and IoT devices or the MQTT broker, preventing eavesdropping and data tampering.
   - **Certificate Management:** Implements proper certificate management for establishing secure connections, ensuring certificates are valid and up to date.

2. **Access Controls and Authentication:**

   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implements RBAC to restrict access to Nagios dashboards and configurations based on user roles, ensuring only authorized personnel can make changes.

   - **Authentication Mechanisms:** Uses strong authentication methods, such as username/password combinations, API tokens, or OAuth, to control access to the monitoring system and IoT device APIs.

3. **Compliance with Security Policies:**

   - **Policy Adherence:** Ensures all monitoring practices comply with organizational security policies and standards, such as ISO 27001 or NIST.
   - **Data Integrity and Confidentiality:** Implements measures to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of monitored data, including encryption, access controls, and regular security audits.
   - **Incident Response:** Defines procedures for responding to security incidents detected by Nagios, ensuring timely and effective remediation.

## 4. Implementation Steps
