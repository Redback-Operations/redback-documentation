## Introduction to Wazuh

Wazuh is a powerful SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform/tool that
monitors, analyses and responds to security threats in a variety of different environments. It
collects and analyses data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive threat
detection incident response.

## Overview of rules and decoders

Wazuh uses rules and decoders to enable high quality success. Rules are predefined or
custom configurations that detect specific patterns or behaviors in logs and initiate alerts or
actions when they are detected. Decoders, on the other hand, parse, and structure raw log
data so that Wazuh's rules engine can read and analyse it.

## Rules and decoders: In relation to Redback Operations’ projects

### Project 1: VR SunCycle and SmartBike

Custom solutions would be required for VR game data integration. Wazuh mainly deals with
security-related logs, so handling VR game data would require the development of custom
loggers within the game or the use of APIs that display game events as loggable data.
Custom decoding mechanisms and rules for game-related security flaws may also be
required. The process of integrating exercise bike metrics into Wazuh is similar. As Wazuh
does not interact with exercise bike data by default, a middleware or interface layer would
be required for converting bike metrics into loggable events. The data would then be
analysed for anomalies or security-related insights using custom decoding configurations
and rules – similarly as mentioned above.

### Project 2: Wearable Tech sensor

Wazuh is not designed to interact directly with GPS tracking data by default. Integrating GPS
tracking data requires the development of custom decoders to parse the GPS device's
unique data format, as well as middleware to bridge the communication gap between the
device and Wazuh. This entails interpreting GPS data, converting it to a loggable format, and
configuring rules to analyse relevant data.

### Project 3 and 4: (Sport Performance Analysis and Data Warehousing)

As these two projects work with data and logs, the same implementations can be used of
creating custom decoders to read the data. Custom rules can be integrated to monitor
access patterns, suspicious activity and data integrity as a whole.

### Alternatives and other Solutions

- Development of Middleware: Create middleware or API (Application Programming Interface)
to translate the device’s data into readable logs for Wazuh

- Custom Integration: Creating custom solutions to connect devices and Wazuh, allowing data
transformation for security analysis.

- External monitoring: By applying specialised monitoring solutions, or platforms designed
specifically for the respective devices - we can integrate them with Wazuh to match data for
overall security insights.
