Therefore, the implementation of OpenCTI will need to leverage this existing infrastructure rather than deploying on traditional on-premises servers or cloud platforms.
 - Software Dependencies: OpenCTI operates on Linux distributions and requires additional software such as PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The technical team must assess whether these can be accommodated within the existing VM infrastructure.
 - University’s VPNcture: The network infrastructure, particularly the use of Deakin University’s VPN, will need to support the secure and efficient operation of OpenCTI. This includes ensuring that data transfer between VMs and other integrated tools (like SIEM, Wazuh, and Nagios) is secure and dependable.

### Compatibility

 - Existing Systems: OpenCTI must be compatible with the tools and systems currently in use within Redback Operations, which are primarily accessed through VMs. This includes ensuring that the VMs have the necessary resources and configurations to support the platform.
 - Protocols: OpenCTI’s support for industry-standard protocols such as STIX/TAXII is crucial for its integration with Redback’s existing tools and external threat intelligence feeds.

### Scalability

 - Infrastructure Constraints: Given the reliance on VMs and the university’s infrastructure, scalability will depend on the available resources within this environment. The feasibility of expanding the infrastructure (e.g., increasing the number of VMs or their resources) must be assessed.
 - Organizational Growth: As Redback Operations grows and potentially takes on more complex cybersecurity projects, the infrastructure supporting OpenCTI must be flexible enough to scale accordingly. This could involve negotiating additional resources from the university or optimizing the use of existing VMs.

### Deployment Considerations

 - Leveraging Existing VMs: Rather than deploying on new on-premises or cloud infrastructure, OpenCTI can be deployed within the existing VM environment provided by Deakin University. This approach minimizes additional costs and complexity.
 - Technical Challenges: Potential challenges include ensuring that VMs have sufficient resources to handle OpenCTI’s requirements, managing data security across VMs, and maintaining performance within the constraints of the university-provided infrastructure.

### Maintenance and Support
