## Introduction

This General Deployment Plan outlines the key steps for implementing endpoint security measures within the organization. The plan is designed to be carried out over two trimesters, with a structured and phased approach. The first trimester focuses on preparation, execution, and initial review, while the second trimester emphasizes continuous monitoring, feedback integration, and long-term maintenance. The tasks outlined for Trimester 2, such as monitoring, feedback collection, and adjustments, can be repeated in continuity for the following trimesters, ensuring ongoing improvements and alignment with evolving security needs. This iterative process ensures that security measures remain effective and up-to-date over time.
