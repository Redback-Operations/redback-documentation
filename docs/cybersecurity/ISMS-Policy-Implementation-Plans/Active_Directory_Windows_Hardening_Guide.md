# Active Directory Windows

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Purpose of this Document
This document is intended to guide administrators to secure Active Directory Windows Server 2016. All administrators should use this document for secure configuration.

## 1.2. Instructions

### 1.2.1. How to Use This Document
The security settings described in this document shall be configured on the Active Directory Windows Server 2016 by the administrators. All settings can only be done with administrative privileges. 

It is strongly recommended that the settings be tested in the staging environment before applying them in the production environment. It is further recommended that the administrators of the Active Directory Windows Server 2016 make note of the original values while changing the settings. For each setting, a detailed description is given, followed by the impact if the setting is not configured and the solution to fix it.

Implementing changes on production systems without first testing them on replica test systems may adversely affect the system/application and may cause it to stop working.

## 2.1. Account Polices 

### 2.1.1. Password Policy & Account Lockout Policy 

#### Control Statement 

Password policies help administrator enforce the strength of passwords that users can set. Password policy is required to control user password characteristics including minimum length, maximum length and password aging. To help prevent password-based attacks from being successful, strong password and account lockout settings need to be configured.  

#### Risk/Impact 

The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can determine the password through brute force attacks.  Risk Rating 

High 

#### Implementation Steps 

Configure a strong Password and Account policy, as suggested in below table. To configure the policy, 

Press Windows key > type Run and type gpedit.msc or rsop.msc. 

Expand Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policy > Password Policy or Account Lockout Policy container and configure the settings as suggested in Appendix 1. 

  

 

## 2.2. Local Polices 

### 2.2.1. User Rights Assignments 

Control Statement 

The user rights settings determine which users or groups have logon rights and other privileges on the server. 

#### Risk/Impact 

If an account is given this right the user of the account may create an application that calls into Credential Manager and is returned the credentials for another user. 

Risk Rating

## 2.6. Encryption 

### 2.6.1. Disable weak encryption protocol 

#### Control Statement 

If configured to require client side certificates, TLS can also play a role in client authentication to the server.  TLS also provides two additional benefits that are commonly overlooked; integrity guarantees and replay prevention. A TLS stream of communication contains built-in controls to prevent tampering with any portion of the encrypted data. In addition, controls are also built-in to prevent a captured stream of TLS data from being replayed at a later time. 

 

TLS provides the above guarantees to data during transmission. TLS does not offer any of these security benefits to data that is at rest. Therefore appropriate security controls must be added to protect data while at rest within the application or within data stores. 

 

Risk/Impact 

An attacker may try to break the integrity of data and also sniff the sensitive information. 

 

Risk Rating 

Medium 

#### Implementation Steps 

To Ensure the SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0 protocol must be disabled on the server and make sure that the stronger TLS protocols are used, follow these instructions to disable Weak SSL protocols:
