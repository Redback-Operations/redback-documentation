## Storage Methods

### Physical Storage Solutions
To enhance physical security for endpoint devices, lockable storage containers will be implemented to secure devices when not in use. These containers will be placed in restricted areas accessible only to authorized personnel, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

For example, biometric access control systems will be used to grant entry to the storage area, ensuring that only designated staff can retrieve or store devices.

### Digital Storage Solutions
Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be selected as the primary cloud storage provider due to its compliance with ISO 27001 standards and robust encryption capabilities. Data stored in AWS will be encrypted both at rest and in transit, with multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforced for access. Backup data will be securely stored in AWS S3 Glacier, ensuring long-term retention and cost-effective storage.

Additionally, Microsoft Azure will serve as a secondary provider to ensure data redundancy and high availability. Azure provides automated backup solutions, complemented by advanced threat protection measures. Backups will adhere to the 3-2-1 strategy: maintaining three copies of data, two of which are local on different devices, and one off-site in Azure's secure cloud environment.

#### Backup Schedule:
- Daily backups will be conducted at the close of business each day, with encrypted data transferred to AWS S3 Glacier.
- Weekly secondary backups will be rotated to Azure’s cloud storage, ensuring that the most recent data is always available in a geographically separated location.
- In case of an emergency, data recovery processes will enable restoration from either AWS or Azure within 24 hours.

#### Data Access:
- User access to cloud-stored data will be managed through role-based access controls via AWS Identity and Access Management and Azure Active Directory.
- Regular reviews of access logs will be conducted, and MFA will be required to enhance security.


## Awareness Training

Upon completion, users will receive certification acknowledging their understanding of the organization’s security policies and practices.


## Least Privilege

### User Access
Role-based access controls (RBAC) will be implemented across all systems to enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users are granted access solely to the resources and functions necessary for their specific roles within Redback Operations. This will help minimize the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data and reduce the potential for insider threats.

- **Access Assignment**: Access levels will be carefully assigned based on a detailed analysis of each user’s job responsibilities, ensuring that no user has access beyond what is required for their role. This includes defining user roles within the RBAC system, categorizing access needs, and assigning permissions accordingly.
  
- **Access Requests**: A formal process will be established for users to request additional access privileges. All such requests will undergo a thorough review and approval process to ensure that any escalations in access are justified and align with organizational security policies.
  
- **Periodic Reviews**: Regular audits of access levels will be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance with the least privilege principle. These reviews will involve verifying that users’ access rights are still appropriate for their current roles, especially following changes in job responsibilities or organizational restructuring.
  
- **Access Revocation**: Immediate revocation of access privileges will be enforced when users change roles, leave the organization, or no longer require certain access for their duties. This process will be automated where possible to ensure timely removal of unnecessary privileges.

### Admin Access
Administrative rights will be strictly controlled and limited to essential personnel only, with a focus on reducing the attack surface associated with elevated privileges. Admin access will be granted based on a clear need-to-know basis, ensuring that only those individuals who require such access to perform critical tasks are granted these rights.


## Ease of Implementation

Thorough testing will be conducted in controlled environments to identify and address potential issues before deployment. This testing will include simulations of various operational scenarios to ensure that all security measures function correctly under different conditions.

Clear and detailed guidelines will be provided to support the deployment of security measures across the organization. These guidelines will include step-by-step instructions, best practices, and troubleshooting tips, ensuring that all personnel can implement the security measures effectively and with minimal disruption.

To streamline ongoing security, systems for automated software updates will be implemented, ensuring that all devices receive timely patches without requiring manual intervention. This approach will minimize the risk of vulnerabilities due to outdated software. Additionally, the use of user-friendly password management tools will be promoted to simplify the creation, storage, and management of strong passwords, further enhancing security while maintaining ease of use.
