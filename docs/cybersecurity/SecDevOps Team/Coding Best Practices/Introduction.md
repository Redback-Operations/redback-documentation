## Introduction to Module:
The following module will hopefully aim to inform the reader about a variety of concepts in the coding world ranging from code smells, best practice methods to reviewing our own code. All of these concepts will be supplied by coding examples in different coding languages and also opportunities to learn from the information supplied to then apply to future programs. 

Throughout the module you will learn about Code Smells and what they are and how to refactor them to avoid the smells appearing in your programs. Coding best practices is also covered along with discussing what we can achieve when we put these into practice. After this the module then showcases a video in which we go through 2 examples of coding and what we need to be aware and look out for when conducting code reviews. Finally the last section of the module contains a quiz for individuals to compile the knowledge they have gained from the module into practical questions to test their understanding and finish the module feeling confident with what they have learnt.

### Contents:
The module is constructed with a number of sections including:
- **Introduction** You are here
