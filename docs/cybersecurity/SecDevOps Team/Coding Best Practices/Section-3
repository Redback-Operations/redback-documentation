This section looks into how we can manually review our own code to catch any potential errors before submisssion.

For this section, various pieces of coding will be presented with various points of interest that need to be reviewed to apply our best practices to: (These will be done in Python and Markdown coding standards for the purpose of this demonstration)
We will then point out what needed to be refactored and why for each coding example as well as a refactored version of the code to demonstrate these coding best practices in action and why it is needed.

- Here is a link to the video in which you can watch to see the code reviewing process in action: *VIDEO URL*

The ability to review your own work saves a lot of time for everyone as it is essentially like the first line of defence. You are trying to catch anything that you can see before it is then processed for another individual to also review. You may not always be able to find everything although, finding something is better than nothing. (Sometimes there may also just be genuinely nothing to find!)
