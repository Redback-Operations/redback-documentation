## 10. Glossary

Provided in this section is a glossary of all relevant terms and object definitions.

-   **Area Path**\
    Defines the hierarchical structure within Azure Boards, representing teams or sub-teams. It helps organize and categorize work items based on team responsibilities.

-   **Epic**\
    A large body of work that encompasses multiple features or tasks. Epics represent significant initiatives or projects that are broken down into smaller, more manageable work items.

-   **Feature**\
    A specific function or deliverable derived from an epic. Features typically take a few sprints to complete and provide value to the project, such as a new security tool rollout or system upgrade.

-   **User Story**\
    A smaller, actionable work item that describes a specific requirement from the perspective of the end user. User stories are typically completed within a single sprint and contribute to a feature's completion.

-   **Task**\
    The smallest unit of work, which is used to track individual activities required to complete user stories or features. Tasks are assigned to team members and have detailed descriptions, deadlines, and priorities.

-   **Bug**\
    A work item representing a defect or issue that needs to be resolved. Bugs are identified during testing or operations and tracked until they are fixed.

-   **Board**\
    A visual interface within Azure Boards that displays work items in different columns, representing stages of progress (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). Each team has its own board to manage tasks and track work.

-   **Sprint**\
    A time-boxed iteration, typically two weeks long, in which a set of tasks or user stories are planned and completed. Sprints help teams prioritize work and meet project goals within a defined timeframe.

-   **Backlog**\
    A collection of work items (epics, features, user stories, and tasks) that have yet to be completed. The backlog is prioritized during sprint planning, and work items are pulled into the sprint based on priority.

-   **Work Item**\
    A general term for any unit of work in Azure Boards, including epics, features, user stories, tasks, and bugs. Work items are created, tracked, and completed by the teams.

-   **Swimlane**\
    A horizontal division on a board that separates work items by categories, such as priority, type, or other criteria. Swimlanes help teams visually organize tasks to focus on specific areas.

-   **Burndown Chart**\
    A graphical representation of the work remaining in a sprint, showing the progress towards sprint completion. It helps teams track whether they are on pace to finish their tasks.

-   **Pull Request**\
    A request made in GitHub to review and merge code changes into a repository. Pull requests are linked to work items in Azure Boards to track code reviews and approvals.

-   **CI/CD Pipeline**\
    The continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline that automates the process of integrating code changes, running automated tests, and deploying applications.

-   **SonarQube**\
    A tool integrated with Azure Boards to automate security and code quality checks during development. It flags potential issues in the code, which are then logged as work items for remediation.

-   **Nagios**\
    An infrastructure monitoring tool integrated with Azure Boards to log system alerts and issues.

-   **Sprint Planning**\
    The process of reviewing the backlog and assigning work items to an upcoming sprint. Teams prioritize tasks and set sprint goals during these planning sessions.

-   **Retrospective**\
    A meeting held at the end of a sprint to review the team\'s performance, identify areas of improvement, and discuss what went well. Action items from retrospectives are often tracked as tasks in Azure Boards.

-   **Query**\
    A custom search filter in Azure Boards that allows users to display specific work items based on criteria such as priority, assignee, or due date. Queries can be saved and reused to track ongoing work.

-   **Dashboard**\
    A visual interface in Azure Boards that displays key metrics, such as task completion rates, sprint progress, or incident response status. Dashboards are customizable for different teams and stakeholders.
