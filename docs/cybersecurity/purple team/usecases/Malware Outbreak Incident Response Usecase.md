Stop the worm from spreading further, remove it from infected systems, and patch security vulnerabilities to prevent future infections.

### 2.2 Steps:

 - Isolate infected systems to prevent further spread: Isolation of infected systems is crucial to prevent the worm from spreading to other devices on the network. This can be achieved by disconnecting the infected systems from the network or by creating VLANs to segregate them from the rest of the network traffic.
 - Identify the entry point and security vulnerabilities exploited by the worm:
Determining how the worm entered the system and the vulnerabilities it exploited is essential for effectively containing and eradicating it. This may involve analyzing system logs, examining network traffic, and conducting vulnerability assessments using tools such as Nessus or OpenVAS.
 - Use network monitoring tools to analyze unusual traffic patterns:
Network monitoring tools like Wireshark or Snort can help in detecting and analyzing unusual traffic patterns associated with the worm's activity. By monitoring network traffic in real-time, administrators can identify suspicious behavior and take appropriate action to mitigate the threat.
 - Employ antivirus or antimalware software to detect and remove worm infections:
Antivirus or antimalware software such as Norton, McAfee, or Malwarebytes can be deployed to detect and remove worm infections from infected systems. It's important to ensure that antivirus definitions are up-to-date to effectively identify and quarantine malicious files associated with the worm.
 - Apply security patches and updates to vulnerable systems:
Patch management is crucial for addressing security vulnerabilities exploited by the worm. Administrators should promptly apply security patches and updates to vulnerable systems to prevent future infections. Patch management tools such as Microsoft SCCM or WSUS can automate the patching process and ensure that systems are adequately protected against known vulnerabilities.

### 2.3 Tools and Techniques:
