investigation and resolution phases.

### Definition of Phishing

Phishing is a technique used by cyber criminals to provide personal information such as
login details and credit card details through making their identity by acting as a legitimate
business or person. Spear Phishing is used by attackers through acquiring information about
employees and the company to provide an element of realism to their attack.

### Scope

This playbook covers phishing attacks that directly impact the organisation through
targeting associated affiliates and stakeholders such as employees and customers. This
playbook does not cover cyber threats such as malware, data theft, virus outbreak, denial of
service, unauthorised access, elevation of privilege, root access, improper usage or recovery
playbooks. Please refer to each individual playbook for the appropriate tools and techniques
to deal with the relevant attack.

### Stakeholders and Audience

This playbook shall be provided to the CIRT and may be used by the CIRT in addition to IT
staff and other relevant personnel. Relevant stakeholders may include the SEMT, legal and
compliance teams, HR teams, customer support teams and external customers. This
playbook establishes the lines of communication and methods to effectively collaborate
during the event of a phishing incident.

## Phishing Summary

### Phishing Attacks

There are a variety of forms that phishing attacks may take. These include:

### Spear Phishing

Spear phishing refers to malicious emails that are sent to a specified person. Cybercriminals
will already have access to personal details about a victim such as a name, employer, job
title, email address and specific information about their role. These attacks are difficult to
detect and can have detrimental effects such as theft of intellectual property or
compromising assets.

### Email Phishing

Email phishing occurs when a cybercriminal registers a fake domain to replicate a real
organisation through techniques such as character substitution or using reputable business
names in their email addresses. They send generic requests via email that appear to be
genuine.

### Whaling

Whaling attacks are targeted at senior management using subtle techniques such as
masking their identity by acting as management asking employees to carry out instructions.
This plays on their willingness to do this without questioning the sender and their authority.
Attackers carry out this attack to gain access to confidential information or execute
fraudulent action with financial, legal and reputational effects.

### Smishing and Vishing

This attack method involves the use of telephones to communicate with victims. Smishing
involves the use of text messages by attackers and vishing involves the use of a telephone conversation. Attackers may use a text message including a link which will direct the victim
to a website creature asking for banking credentials. Vishing involves the attacker imitating
a bank employee asking for the victimâ€™s credentials through the use of phone calls.
