## 1. Introduction

The security of data, the continuity of operations, and the reputation of the organisation are all seriously threatened by virus outbreaks. To reduce damage and guarantee company resilience, virus attacks must be promptly identified, contained, and mitigated. This playbook outlines roles, duties, and processes for a successful response, providing an organised method for handling viral epidemics.

### 1.1	Overview

There is a methodical structure available in the Virus Outbreak Incident Response Playbook for identifying, stopping, eliminating, and recovering from virus attacks. It seeks to expedite reaction efforts and lessen the impact of viral outbreaks on organisational assets and stakeholders by developing defined standards and communication channels.

### 1.2 Purpose

This playbook's goals are to:

 - Create a standardised procedure for handling viral outbreaks to guarantee efficacy and uniformity in event handling.
 - Make it easier to quickly identify and confine viruses to stop their spread and reduce harm.
 - Reduce the effect of viral outbreaks on the functioning of organisations and the resulting financial losses.
 - During incident response efforts, encourage cooperation, coordination, and communication amongst response teams, stakeholders, and other relevant parties.

### 1.3 Attack Definition

Malicious software, such as viruses, are created with the intent to harm, interfere with, or get unauthorised access to computer systems, networks, and data. They cover a wide range of dangers, such as ransomware, worms, trojans, and spyware, among others. Numerous routes, including malicious websites, email attachments, infected files, and software flaws, can allow viruses to enter a system.

### 1.4	Scope

Events related to virus outbreaks that impact the computers, networks, and endpoints of the company are covered in this playbook. It covers viral occurrences that affect stakeholders, data assets, and company procedures from both external and internal sources. This playbook is applicable to any situation that calls for a coordinated response, regardless of the type of virus or mode of distribution.


## 2. Attack Types 

There are several ways that virus outbreaks might appear, and each one poses different difficulties for incident response teams. The subsequent assault types are frequently linked to viral outbreaks:

### 2.1 File Infector Viruses

When executable files are opened, file infector viruses cling to them, multiply, and spread to other files, causing extensive harm.

Signs of File Infector Virus Activity:
 - Unknown corruption or alteration of executable files.
 - Unexpected variations in checksums or file sizes.
 - Reports of malicious file alarms from antivirus software.
 - Unexpected rise in system resource consumption brought on by viral propagation.
 - Suspicious network traffic coming from machines that have been compromised.

### 2.2 Macro Viruses

Macro viruses propagate by infecting spreadsheets and documents that include macros. The macros are subsequently performed when the file is accessed, potentially leading to data loss or system interruption.

Signs of Macro Viruses Activity:
 - Unusual actions or error messages while attempting to open spreadsheets or documents.
 - Emails with links to malicious documents or attachments that seem suspicious.
 - Reports of unforeseen modifications to the layout or substance of documents.
 - Infected papers are found and quarantined by antivirus software.
 - Increased network traffic because of the transmission or sharing of infected documents.

### 2.3 Boot Sector Viruses

The master boot record (MBR) or boot sector of storage devices can get infected with boot sector viruses, which impair the system's ability to start correctly and may result in data loss or system failure.

Signs of Boot Sector Viruses Activity:
 - Anomalous errors during the boot process or the system's inability to boot up. Reports of system files being damaged or missing.
 - Notifications from antivirus software that boot sector viruses are present.
 - Adjustments to disc partitions or partition tables that are not explained.
 - Suspicious behaviour on the network coming from devices that are infected and trying to propagate the infection.

### 2.4 Polymorphic Viruses

With every infection, polymorphic viruses alter their look and coding structure, making antivirus software's job of detecting and eliminating them more difficult.

Signs of Polymorphic Viruses Activity:
 - Files with often changing signatures are identified by antivirus software and placed in quarantine.
 - Random crashes or problems on compromised devices that are not explained.
 - Reports of unusual or unpredictable behaviour from files or apps.
 - A rise in network traffic as the virus looks to infect other machines.
 - System logs demonstrating many attempts to run malicious code with different characteristics.


### 2.5 Resident Viruses

Because resident viruses lodge themselves in system memory, they can continue to function even after the system is restarted.

Signs of Resident Virus Activity:
 - Unexpected system lag or deterioration in performance.
 - Antivirus software that looks for infections in RAM.
 - Persistence in task management or process monitor of processes linked to viruses.


### 2.6 Multipartite Viruses

Multipartite viruses combine the traits of boot sector and file infector viruses to infect executable files as well as boot sectors, hence increasing their effect and spread.

Signs of Multipartite Viruses Activity:
 - Several antivirus notifications pointing to viruses in the boot sector and files.
 - System instability or crashes that happen when apps are running, or the system is booting up.
 - Reports pertaining to damaged or lost data in the impacted files and storage devices.
 - Adjustments to system setups or settings that are not explained.
 - Network behaviour suggestive of the spread of viruses via network drives or shared data.


### 2.7 Network Viruses

By exploiting holes in network protocols or services, network viruses propagate via network connections.

Signs of Network Viruses Activity:
 - Abnormal trends in network traffic or sudden increases in network utilisation.
 - Warnings from antivirus software that viruses are proliferating over network sharing.
 - Identification of questionable behaviour on servers or network equipment.


### 2.8 Stealth Viruses

To avoid being discovered by antivirus software, stealth viruses hide their existence and carry out their operations. They frequently use sophisticated strategies to stay undetected.

Signs of Stealth Viruses Activity:
 - Abnormal trends in network traffic or sudden increases in network utilisation.
 - Suspicious behaviour or symptoms, yet antivirus scans show no viruses.
 - Unusual modifications to file properties or timestamps that suggest manipulation.
 - Anomalies that point to possible illegal access or manipulation in system logs or event data.
 - Unusual activity on the network coming from devices that are compromised.
 - Reports of anomalous activity or decreased system performance on infected systems.

## 6. Terminology

 - **Virus Outbreak**: A circumstance in which malicious software quickly spreads throughout the computers, networks, or devices of an organisation, usually with the goal of stealing, interfering with, or breaching data.

 - **Incident Response**: A methodical and organised procedure designed to locate, contain, and lessen the harm a virus outbreak does to an organization's IT infrastructure to minimise interruption and get things back to normal.

 - **Forensic Analysis**: The methodical analysis and assessment of digital data associated with the virus outbreak, such as malware samples, system artefacts, and network logs, to determine the source of the attack, estimate its extent, and supply proof for legal or investigative needs.

 - **Polymorphic Virus**: A kind of virus that is challenging for antivirus software to identify and neutralise as it can alter its appearance or signature with every infection. During virus outbreaks, polymorphic viruses are renowned for their capacity to spread quickly and elude detection by conventional security measures.

 - **Endpoint Security**: A thorough method for protecting mobile, laptop, and desktop computer systems—known as network endpoints—against online dangers including viruses. To prevent virus outbreaks, endpoint security solutions include host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS), antivirus software, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) technologies.

 - **Infection Vector**: The process or avenue via which a virus enters a network or organisation and infects systems. Email attachments, malicious websites, portable media (like USB drives), and software flaws are frequently used as entry points for virus outbreaks.

 - **Cyber Threat Hunting**: Initiative-taking monitoring and scanning of networks and systems for indications of malicious behaviour or possible virus outbreaks. Cyber threat hunting is the process of identifying and eliminating threats before they become widespread viral outbreaks by examining network traffic, system behaviour, and records.
