## 1. Introduction

An organization's reputation may be harmed, confidential data may be compromised, and financial losses may ensue from data theft occurrences. To minimise the effects of data theft events and protect organisational assets, this playbook offers methods and principles for doing so.

### 1.1	Overview

A structured approach for identifying, containing, mitigating, and recovering from data theft events is described in the data theft incident response playbook. To enable a well-coordinated and efficient response effort, it sets roles, duties, and protocols.

### 1.2 Purpose

This playbook's goals are to:
-Establish a uniform framework for handling situations involving data theft.
-Make sure that data breaches are promptly detected and contained.
-Reduce the negative effects that data theft events have on the stakeholders, the organization's operations, and its reputation.
-Encourage response teams and stakeholders to collaborate, coordinate, and communicate with one another.

### 1.3 Attack Definition

Unauthorised access to, exfiltration of, or exposure of confidential company information is referred to as data theft. This can contain financial information, confidential information, intellectual property, and personally identifiable information (PII). Incidents of data theft can be caused by several techniques, including as malware, social engineering, phishing, external assaults, and insider threats.

### 1.4	Scope
Any incidences of data theft affecting the systems, apps, networks, and data assets of the company are covered by this playbook. It includes events that have an impact on both internal and external stakeholders, such as partners, customers, staff members, and outside vendors. Regardless of the origin or mode of attack, instances involving both purposeful and accidental data theft are included in the scope.

## 2. Attack Types 
The different types of Data-Theft attacks include:

### 2.1 Insider Threat
An insider threat is when someone steals data from an organisation by using contractors, business partners, or employees.

Signs of Insider Threat:
 -  Abnormal access patterns: Workers accessing private data after hours or on the weekends, in addition to their regular duties.
 - Illegal data access: Workers gaining access to systems or files for which they are not normally authorised.
 - Unauthorised information sharing: Workers disclosing private information to outside parties or persons they are not authorised to.
 - Behavioural or performance changes: Workers displaying abrupt behavioural shifts, such heightened confidentiality or attempts to avoid discovery.
 - Employee discontent or unhappiness: When staff members voice their unhappiness with their jobs or the company, it may spark aggressive behaviour.


### 2.2 External Attack
Data theft carried out by external parties, such as nation-state enemies, hackers, or cybercriminals, is referred to as an external attack.

Signs of External Attack: 
 - Illegal entry attempts: Brute force attacks or suspicious login attempts directed at the networks or systems of the company.
 - Unusual patterns of network traffic: Distinctive communication patterns or massive amounts of data being moved to other sites are examples of anomalies in network traffic.
 - Malicious software or malware presence: Finding malware problems, including ransomware, trojans, or keyloggers, on the company's networks or systems.
 - Phishing attempts: Getting shady emails or communications that try to fool staff members into disclosing private information or installing malicious software.
 - Exploitation of applications or system vulnerabilities: Identification of attempted or accomplished exploitation of known weaknesses in the infrastructure of the company, such as improperly configured systems or unpatched software.


### 2.3 Data Breaches
Data breaches happen when unapproved parties obtain entry to confidential data that is kept on file by a company.

Signs of Data Breaches:
 - Unexpected modifications to a user's rights or access authorisation.
 - Unauthorised access attempts indicated by anomalies in system logs.
 - Abnormal network activity patterns, such massive data transfers to other addresses.
 - Conditions in user behaviour, including accessing private information after hours.

### 2.4 Phishing Attacks
Phishing attacks include sending people false emails or messages with the intention of fooling them into disclosing private information, including login passwords or bank account information.

Signs of Phishing Attacks:
 - Getting faked or unknown sender emails that raise red flags.
 - Email or message requests for private information, including account numbers or passwords.
 - Links in emails that take recipients to phoney websites intended to steal login information.
 - Sent with bad grammar or poor writing quality.

### 2.5 Ransomware Attacks
Ransomware attacks entail the introduction of software into a victim's computer or network, encrypting files and requesting payment for the key to unlock them.

Signs of Ransomware Attacks:
 - Unable to access folders or files because they are encrypted.
 - The appearance of messages requesting money in order to unlock the ransom.
 - Abnormal network behaviour as the malware propagates.
 - The existence of files or processes connected to ransomware on compromised computers.


### 2.6 Credential Theft
Theft of login credentials, which include usernames and passwords, from people or organisations is known as credential theft. The goal is to obtain unauthorised access to accounts or systems.

Signs of Credential Theft:
 - Notifications of illegal access to systems or user accounts.
 - Unusual locations or a pattern of unsuccessful login attempts are examples of anomalies in login behaviour.
 - Malware that is intended to intercept keystrokes or steal passwords that have been stored.
 - Using credentials that have been stolen to gain access to private data or carry out unauthorised activities.
