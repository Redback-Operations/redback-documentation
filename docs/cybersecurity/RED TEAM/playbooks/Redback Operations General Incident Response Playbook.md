## 6. Terminology

Terminology in incident response encompasses a range of concepts and terms essential for effective communication and understanding within the cybersecurity domain. It provides a common language for incident responders, enabling precise and unambiguous communication during incident response activities. 

- An essential part of Redback Operations' cybersecurity setup is an intrusion detection system (IDS). IDS keeps an eye on network traffic to look for indications of malicious activity, unauthorised access, or security lapses. Network packets and system logs are analysed by IDS to find anomalies or patterns that point to possible security risks. When an improper usage occurrence occurs, Redback's occurrence Response Team can investigate and take appropriate action based on the alarms generated by IDS.  
- SIEM, or Security Information and Event Management, is essential to Redback's incident response operations. SIEM provides real-time visibility into security incidents by gathering, correlating, and analysing security event data from several sources throughout the IT architecture of the company. SIEM improves Redback's overall security posture and resilience against improper usage incidents by aggregating and correlating security data, making it easier to identify and respond to security threats.  
- Redback uses vulnerability assessment as a preventative strategy to find and fix security flaws in its networks and systems. Redback performs vulnerability assessments to find known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or weaknesses that threat actors could exploit through routine scanning and analysis. Redback improves its security defences and lowers the possibility of improper usage situations by prioritising remediation activities according to the severity and impact of vulnerabilities.  
- Redback's cybersecurity defences face a substantial challenge from zero-day vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are security holes in software or systems that were previously undiscovered or revealed, making organisations open to abuse by hostile parties. Redback keeps a quick response capability to handle new threats and continually searches for zero-day vulnerabilities. Redback increases its resilience against sophisticated cyber threats and reduces the danger caused by zero-day vulnerabilities by putting proactive measures like threat intelligence sharing and patch management into place.
