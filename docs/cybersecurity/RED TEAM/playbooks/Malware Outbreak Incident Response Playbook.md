## 1. Introduction

Data integrity, reputation, and company operations are all seriously at danger from malware outbreaks. To reducing harm and guaranteeing business continuity, timely malware incident identification, containment, and mitigation are essential. This playbook offers a systematic approach for managing malware outbreaks, defining roles, duties, and procedures to enable a successful response.

### 1.1 Overview

The incident response playbook for malware outbreaks provides a structured approach to locating, stopping, eliminating, and recovering from attacks by malware. It seeks to expedite reaction efforts and lessen the effect of malware breakouts on organisational assets and stakeholders by creating defined protocols and communication channels.

### 1.2 Purpose

This playbook's goals are to:
 - Provide a uniform procedure for tackling malware outbreaks to guarantee consistency and effectiveness in incident management. 
 - To stop malware from spreading further and to reduce damage, make it easier for occurrences to be quickly detected and contained. 
 - Reduce the impact of malware outbreaks on company operations and lower the financial losses they cause. 
 - During incident response activities, encourage cooperation, coordination, and communication amongst response teams, stakeholders, and other relevant parties.

### 1.3	Attack Definition

Malware is software that is intentionally created to cause harm, interfere with operations, or obtain unauthorised access to data, networks, and computer systems. It includes a wide range of dangers, including as trojans, worms, viruses, ransomware, and spyware. Multiple routes, including portable media, malicious websites, email attachments, and software flaws, can lead to malware epidemics.

### 1.4 Scope

The events regarding the malware outbreak on the computers, networks, and endpoints of the company are covered in this playbook. It includes malware problems, both external and internal, that impact stakeholders, data assets, and company processes. This playbook covers all occurrences requiring an integrated effort, regardless of the type of malware or transmission technique.

## 2. Attack Types

Malware outbreaks may take many different shapes, and responding to each one presents different difficulties for incident response teams. Malware outbreaks are often linked to the following attack types:

### 2.1 Worms

Worms are viruses that reproduce themselves and travel around networks, taking advantage of security holes to quickly infect linked computers.

Signs of Worm Activity:
 - Unusual network traffic increases, suggesting extensive spreading. 
 - Worm replication is the cause of the network's rapid bandwidth usage. 
 - Increased memory or CPU consumption on compromised computers. 
 - System logs containing files or processes that are unknown.
 - Random system restarts or crashes brought on by worm activity.

### 2.2 Trojans

Trojan horses pose as trustworthy applications to deceive users into downloading and running malicious malware, which gives attackers access to infected computers without permission.

Signs of Trojan Infection: 
 - Suspicious applications or processes running in the background. 
 - Unusual changes made to files or system settings by Trojan payloads. 
 - Remote attackers gaining unlawful access to private information or system resources. 
 - Unexpected toolbar or programme installation on compromised computers. 
 - Abnormalities in the way the system operates, including sluggishness or frequent crashes.

### 2.3 Ransomware

Ransomware encrypts files or prevents users from accessing their computers, and then demands a fee to unlock the system or restore access.

Signs of Ransomware Activity:
 - Files that are inaccessible and have a.locky or.crypt file extension are encrypted. 
 - Appearance of warning messages or ransom notes requesting money to unlock files. 
 - Alteration of file dates or properties through the encryption procedures of ransomware.
 - Unusual patterns of network traffic as the ransomware talks to the servers that govern it. 
 - Existence on compromised systems of ransomware-related artefacts, such as executables or registry entries.

### 2.4 Botnets

Botnets are networks of infected devices under the control of hackers, frequently employed to carry out coordinated assaults or disseminate malware payloads.

Signs of Botnet Infection:
 - Strange outgoing network connections to command-and-control sites made by compromised devices. 
 - Large amounts of harmful or spam emails coming from infected computers. 
 - Botnet activity on compromised devices is causing high CPU or bandwidth utilisation. 
 - The existence of backdoor trojans or remote access programmes that facilitate botnet communication. 
 - Unexpected alterations in system behaviour or performance brought on by botnet activity.

### 2.5 Spyware

Without user agreement, spyware secretly records private user data, gathers it, and sends it to hostile parties.

Signs of Spyware Presence:
 - Unexpected adjustments to the homepage or default search engine in a browser. 
 - Display of inappropriate pop-up advertisements or browser reroutes to unsafe websites. 
 - Existence of toolbars or unusual browser extensions that have been installed without permission.  
 - Spyware activity might cause a slow internet connection or poor browser performance.  
 - Criminals gaining illegal access to passwords, surfing history, or sensitive information.


### 2.6 Adware

Without the user's permission, adware gathers user data for targeted advertising, displays invasive adverts, and reroutes web traffic.

Signs of Adware Infection:
 - Sudden emergence of unwelcome pop-up advertising or banners when browsing the internet.
 - Redirects users who click on links or search results to dubious or harmful websites. 
 - Adware processes causing slow browser speed or frequent crashes. 
 - Altering the main page or preferred search engine in a browser without permission. 
 - Data, database entries, or browser extensions connected to adware being present on compromised machines.

## 6. Terminology

 - **Malware Outbreak**: A circumstance in which malicious software quickly spreads throughout the computers, networks, or devices of a company, usually with the goal of stealing, disrupting, or infiltrating data.

 - **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**: Indications of potentially harmful activity that may be seen in an organization's IT infrastructure and that point to the existence of malware, or a security breech connected to the outbreak.

 - **Incident Response**: A methodical and structured process for locating, controlling, and lessening the damage that a malware outbreak does to an organization's IT infrastructure to reduce interruption and get things back to normal.

 - **Forensic Analysis**: The careful inspection and evaluation of digital evidence associated with the malware outbreak, including system artefacts, malware samples, and network logs, to determine the origin of the attack, gauge its scope, and provide proof for legal or investigative needs.

 - **Security Controls**: Defensive measures and protections, including as firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and endpoint protection solutions, put in place to identify, stop, and reduce the impact of a malware outbreak.

 - **Vulnerability**: Vulnerabilities or holes in a company's networks, apps, or IT systems that might be used by malware to propagate, get improper access, or do damage. Preventing and managing malware outbreaks requires the identification and patching of vulnerabilities.

 - **Phishing**: A popular attack vector that hackers employ to fool people into disclosing private information, including passwords, usernames, and financial information. This is frequently done through fake emails, websites, or texts. Phishing assaults have the potential to spread malware and start an outbreak of the infection inside a company.
