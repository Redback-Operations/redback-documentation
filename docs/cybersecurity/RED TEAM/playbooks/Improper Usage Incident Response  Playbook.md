### 1.3 Attack Definition

At Redback Operations, incidents involving improper usage can take many different forms, each with unique difficulties and consequences for incident response. Insider threats are internal threats that come from staff members abusing their access rights for improper reasons, such as sabotage, personal gain, or other nefarious motive. Insider threats can take many different forms, from unintentional data disclosure from carelessness to intentional acts of sabotage meant to compromise sensitive data or interfere with operations.  

However, external attacks are planned by hostile organisations outside of Redback with the intention of compromising systems, stealing data, or interfering with business operations to obtain financial advantage or carry out other evil deeds. Targeting Redback's networks, applications, or infrastructure, these assaults could be sophisticated hacks like malware infections, denial-of-service attacks, or hacking.  

### 1.4 Scope

This playbook covers all types of inappropriate or unauthorised use of Redback Operations' resources, systems, or data. It is intended to handle cases of improper usage. The playbook offers instructions for handling different kinds of improper usage issues, whether they are the result of malevolent external intent or internal carelessness. This guarantees a well- coordinated and efficient response that is in line with Redback's goals and priorities.  

The playbook gives Redback the flexibility and adaptability required to effectively respond to changing threats and challenges by covering a broad range of attack types and situations. The playbook includes practical insights and tactics for managing risks, controlling incidents, and minimising their impact on Redback's operations, ranging from internal threats to external assaults, data breaches, phishing attempts, ransomware outbreaks, and credential theft. 

## 2 Attack Types 

### 2.1 Insider Threat  

The security and integrity of Redback Operations' data are seriously threatened by insider threats. These threats entail members of the organisation abusing their access rights for improper intent, which may result in data breaches, sabotage, or the unlawful publication of private information. Insider risks might arise from disgruntled employees, careless behaviour, or unintentional activities. As such, they are challenging to identify and prevent in the absence of effective monitoring and reaction processes.  

### 2.2 External Attack

External assaults use a variety of strategies and techniques to infiltrate systems, steal data, or interfere with operations in order to target Redback Operations from outside the company. Cybercriminals, nation-state actors, or other hostile organisations may be the source of these assaults if they are attempting to take advantage of holes in Redback's networks, applications, or infrastructure. Advanced cyberattacks, such as phishing, malware infections, or denial-of- service assaults, are frequently used in external attacks with the intention of breaching Redback's defences and taking advantage of flaws for illicit financial gain or other goals.  

### 2.3 Data Breaches

The security and confidentiality of Redback Operations' data are seriously threatened by data breaches. These instances happen when private or sensitive data is obtained, revealed, or taken without permission, putting Redback at risk of loss of money, legal repercussions, and harm to its reputation. Internal threats, external attacks, and other weaknesses in Redback's systems or procedures can lead to data breaches, which emphasises the significance of strong data protection measures and incident response procedures in reducing the risks and repercussions of such incidents.  

### 2.4 Phishing Incidents

Phishing attacks use phoney emails, messages, or websites to target Redback Operations' stakeholders and employees with the intention of tricking them into divulging private information, including login passwords or financial information. These assaults can be challenging to identify and stop without the right knowledge and training since they frequently pose as authentic messages from reliable sources. Phishing attacks have the potential to cause financial fraud, data breaches, or unauthorised access to Redback's systems, which emphasises the significance of preventative steps like email filtering and security awareness training in reducing the dangers associated with these occurrences.  

### 2.5 Ransomware Attacks

The data security and operational continuity of Redback Operations are seriously threatened by ransomware assaults. In order to encrypt data or prevent users from accessing computers, malicious software is deployed in these attacks. The attackers then demand a ransom to unlock the encrypted data or to get access back. Attacks using ransomware have the potential to cause data loss, financial extortion, and operational interruptions. This emphasises the significance of having strong backup and recovery procedures in place, as well as proactive steps to stop and lessen the effects of such situations. 

### 2.6 Credential Theft

One popular strategy used by attackers to obtain unauthorised access to Redback Operations' systems or networks is credential theft. Phishing attacks, social engineering, and other techniques could be used in these incidents to trick employees or stakeholders into giving over their login credentials or authentication tokens. It is crucial to have robust authentication procedures, user awareness, and monitoring in place to identify and lessen the risks associated with credential theft incidents because, with compromised credentials, attackers can evade authentication mechanisms, obtain privileged access to confidential data, or engage in unauthorised activities within Redback's infrastructure.

## 6 Terminology 

Terminology in incident response encompasses a range of concepts and terms essential for effective communication and understanding within the cybersecurity domain. It provides a common language for incident responders, enabling precise and unambiguous communication during incident response activities. 

- An essential part of Redback Operations' cybersecurity setup is an intrusion detection system (IDS). IDS keeps an eye on network traffic to look for indications of malicious activity, unauthorised access, or security lapses. Network packets and system logs are analysed by IDS to find anomalies or patterns that point to possible security risks. When an improper usage occurrence occurs, Redback's occurrence Response Team can investigate and take appropriate action based on the alarms generated by IDS.  

- SIEM, or Security Information and Event Management, is essential to Redback's incident response operations. SIEM provides real-time visibility into security incidents by gathering, correlating, and analysing security event data from several sources throughout the IT architecture of the company. SIEM improves Redback's overall security posture and resilience against improper usage incidents by aggregating and correlating security data, making it easier to identify and respond to security threats. 

- Redback uses vulnerability assessment as a preventative strategy to find and fix security flaws in its networks and systems. Redback performs vulnerability assessments to find known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or weaknesses that threat actors could exploit through routine scanning and analysis. Redback improves its security defences and lowers the possibility of improper usage situations by prioritising remediation activities according to the severity and impact of vulnerabilities.  

- Redback's cybersecurity defences face a substantial challenge from zero-day vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are security holes in software or systems that were previously undiscovered or revealed, making organisations open to abuse by hostile parties. Redback keeps a quick response capability to handle new threats and continually searches for zero-day vulnerabilities. Redback increases its resilience against sophisticated cyber threats and reduces the danger caused by zero-day vulnerabilities by putting proactive measures like threat intelligence sharing and patch management into place.
