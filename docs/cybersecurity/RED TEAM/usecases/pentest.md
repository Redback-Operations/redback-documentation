## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This penetration test evaluated the security of the Deakin University server (redback.it.deakin.edu.au, IP: 10.137.0.149) and identified several critical issues:

- **Apache Vulnerabilities**: The Apache HTTP Server (v2.4.41) on port 8080 has severe vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-38476, CVE-2024-38474) that could enable remote code execution or denial of service.
- **Weak Authentication**: Default credentials on MinIO Console (port 9001) allowed unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
- **SSL/TLS Misconfigurations**: Problems included incomplete certificate chains, domain mismatches, and LOGJAM vulnerability (CVE-2015-4000).
- **Exposed Files**: Sensitive backup and certificate files were found, risking data exposure.
- **Content Security Policy Issues**: On port 443, the policy permits 'unsafe-eval' and 'unsafe-inline', making it vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
- **No HSTS**: The absence of HTTP Strict Transport Security leaves the server susceptible to downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking.

### Key Recommendations:

- Update Apache HTTP Server to the latest stable version.
- Strengthen authentication with unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication.
- Fix SSL/TLS configurations and implement HSTS.
- Remove or secure sensitive files.
- Improve Content Security Policy to restrict unsafe practices.
- Perform regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing.

The ease of unauthorized access highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive security overhaul to protect Deakin University's digital assets.

## 5.2 PORT 443 ANALYSIS

### Website
![Wazuh.png](img/Wazuh.png)
![Wazuh2.jpg](img/Wazuh2.jpg)

The server title is "Wazuh," and it appears to redirect to the login page (`/app/login?`). This suggests it might be running Wazuh, which is an open-source security monitoring platform.

![Wazuh3.png](img/Wazuh3.png)

The server on port 443 supports the following HTTP methods:
- GET
- HEAD
- POST
- OPTIONS

![Wazuh4.png](img/Wazuh4.png)

The HTTP headers for port 443 reveal the following:
- **Set-Cookie:** `security_authentication` is set but immediately expired.
- **Content-Security-Policy:** Allows `unsafe-eval` and `unsafe-inline`, which could be risky.
- **X-Frame-Options:** Set to `sameorigin`, which is good for preventing clickjacking.
- **Cache-Control:** Properly set to prevent caching.

The `Content-Security-Policy` header is notable. The use of `unsafe-eval` and `unsafe-inline` could be a security concern, as these settings can make the application more vulnerable to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.

![Wazuh4.jpg](img/Wazuh5.jpg)

The SSL/TLS cipher suite results show the following:
- **TLSv1.2:** The server supports a range of strong ciphers, all rated "A" (excellent). There are no weak or deprecated ciphers.
- **TLSv1.3:** Similarly, the ciphers supported are also rated "A" and are strong.

# 5.3 PORT 9200 ANALYSIS

## PORT 9200:
![9200.jpg](img/9200.jpg)

![9200.1jpg](img/9200.1.jpg)

The output I received is from an Nmap scan using the `-sV` and `--script ssl-enum-ciphers` options. These options are used for service detection and to enumerate SSL/TLS ciphers supported by a service running on port 9200, which is typically associated with Elasticsearch or a similar service. From this scan, it's evident that the server is running SSL with several strong ciphers. The scan also provides detailed information about cipher strength, Diffie-Hellman key lengths, and the protocol versions in use (TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3).

This scan is useful for identifying potential vulnerabilities related to cryptographic protocols. Weak ciphers, improper configuration, or insufficient Diffie-Hellman parameters can leave the service vulnerable to attacks like man-in-the-middle (MITM) or cipher downgrade attacks. However, based on the scan results, the server appears to be using secure and modern ciphers (all rated 'A'), which lowers the risk of vulnerabilities related to weak encryption.

One potential concern is the Diffie-Hellman key exchange (dh 2048). Although 2048-bit keys are generally considered secure, key sizes smaller than 2048 bits are often deemed weak. Moving forward, it might be advisable to consider upgrading to even stronger key sizes, such as 4096 bits, to enhance security further.

![9200.7png](img/9200.7.png)

## 1. LOGJAM (CVE-2015-4000)

**Why It’s a Vulnerability:**
- **Description:** LOGJAM is a vulnerability affecting the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm used in TLS. This vulnerability allows attackers to downgrade the security of encrypted communications by forcing the use of weak cryptographic parameters. Specifically, it targets servers that use common prime numbers (1024-bit) for key exchange.
- **Impact:** An attacker can potentially decrypt intercepted traffic or perform a man-in-the-middle attack, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the data being exchanged.
- **Issue:** The report indicates that the server is vulnerable because it uses a common prime (RFC2409/Oakley Group 2, 1024 bits) for Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

**Explanation:**
- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:** This algorithm allows two parties to securely share a common key over an insecure channel. However, if the parameters are weak, an attacker can exploit the weakness to decrypt the traffic.
- **Common Prime:** Using a common, weak prime makes it easier for attackers to perform mathematical attacks and recover the key used for encryption.

## 2. LUCKY13 (CVE-2013-0169)

**Why It’s a Vulnerability:**
- **Description:** LUCKY13 is a vulnerability in the implementation of the CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode of encryption used in TLS. This vulnerability allows attackers to perform a padding oracle attack, potentially leading to the exposure of plaintext data.
- **Impact:** An attacker could potentially recover sensitive information from encrypted traffic by exploiting timing discrepancies in the way the server handles padding errors.

**Explanation:**
- **CBC Mode:** CBC mode is a method of encrypting data where each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. This mode can leak information about the plaintext through timing attacks if not implemented securely.
- **Padding Oracle Attack:** This attack exploits the way the server processes padding errors to infer details about the plaintext, which could be used to decrypt the message.

## 3. Certificate Chain Issues

**Why It’s a Vulnerability:**
- **Description:** The certificate chain is incomplete, meaning the server's SSL/TLS certificate does not correctly link back to a trusted root certificate authority (CA). This can result in issues with trust and validation.
- **Impact:** Browsers and other clients may not trust the server’s certificate, leading to warnings or failures in establishing secure connections.

**Explanation:**
- **Certificate Chain:** For a certificate to be trusted, it must be part of a chain that links it back to a trusted root CA. An incomplete chain means that intermediates or root certificates are missing, which prevents proper verification.
- **Trust Issues:** Without a complete chain, clients cannot validate the authenticity of the server’s certificate, which can lead to trust and security issues.

## 4. Domain Name Mismatch

**Why It’s a Vulnerability:**
- **Description:** The certificate presented by the server does not match the domain name used to connect to it. This means that the certificate is not valid for the domain in question.
- **Impact:** Clients connecting to the server may receive warnings or errors about the certificate mismatch, which can undermine trust in the server's identity and security.

**Explanation:**
- **Certificate Validation:** Certificates are issued for specific domain names. A mismatch occurs when the domain name on the certificate does not match the domain name of the server. This can happen if the server's certificate is misconfigured or if a malicious actor is intercepting connections.

## 5. HSTS Not Offered

**Why It’s a Vulnerability:**
- **Description:** HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a security feature that forces browsers to use HTTPS for all communications with a server. If HSTS is not offered, browsers might not enforce this security measure.
- **Impact:** Without HSTS, users are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and modify communications between the browser and the server.

**Explanation:**
- **HSTS:** HSTS is a mechanism that tells browsers to only use HTTPS when communicating with a server, preventing any possibility of plain HTTP connections. This helps protect against downgrade attacks and eavesdropping.
- **No HSTS:** If a server does not use HSTS, it leaves users exposed to potential attacks where traffic could be intercepted or altered.

These vulnerabilities can significantly impact the security of your communications and data. Addressing them involves updating server configurations, improving encryption practices, and ensuring that certificates are correctly issued and validated.

- **Strengthen Authentication**: Replace default credentials (e.g., on the MinIO Console) with strong, unique passwords. Implement multi-factor authentication where feasible.
- **Enhance SSL/TLS Security**:
  - Disable outdated and weak ciphers and protocols.
  - Resolve the LOGJAM vulnerability by adopting stronger Diffie-Hellman parameters (at least 2048-bit).
  - Enforce HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
- **Resolve Certificate Issues**:
  - Ensure that the SSL certificate aligns with the domain name.
  - Complete the certificate chain to prevent trust errors.
- **Secure Sensitive Files**: Remove or protect sensitive backup and certificate files found during the Nikto scan.
- **Improve Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Eliminate 'unsafe-eval' and 'unsafe-inline' from the CSP header on port 443.
- **Close Unnecessary Ports**: Review all open ports and close those that are not essential to operations.

- **Perform Regular Penetration Testing**: Schedule periodic penetration tests to uncover and resolve potential security gaps.
- **Implement SIEM Solution**: Introduce a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for better monitoring and incident response.
- **Develop and Test an Incident Response Plan**: Create a comprehensive incident response plan and perform regular drills to maintain readiness.
- **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure users and service accounts have only the minimal access they require.
- **Enhance Employee Security Awareness**: Provide regular training sessions for employees, focusing on recognizing phishing and adhering to security best practices.
- **Implement Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Use DLP tools to prevent unauthorized data leaks.

# 7. Conclusion

The penetration test conducted on the Deakin University server (redback.it.deakin.edu.au) revealed several serious vulnerabilities that demand immediate remediation. Key issues include multiple critical vulnerabilities in the Apache HTTP Server, weak authentication mechanisms, and misconfigured SSL/TLS settings.

One of the most concerning findings was how easily an attacker could gain unauthorized access and escalate privileges, demonstrated by the successful creation of an administrative user on the MinIO Console. Additionally, the presence of sensitive backup files and the use of default credentials pose significant risks to the system’s confidentiality and integrity.

Although some security best practices, such as the use of strong SSL/TLS ciphers in certain areas, are in place, the server’s overall security posture requires significant improvement. By implementing the short-term mitigations and long-term security enhancements outlined in this report, the system’s security can be substantially strengthened, reducing the risk of successful attacks.

Addressing these recommendations promptly, while conducting regular security assessments like vulnerability scans and penetration tests, will help ensure the continued security of the system. A proactive approach, combined with fostering a security-conscious culture, will help Deakin University protect its digital assets from potential cyber threats.
