### Detect the services running on port 27017:

![Finding the Services running on Port 27017](img/PortServices.png)

#### Explanation:
- 	-sV: This option enables version detection. It attempts to determine the version of the service running on the open ports.
-	-p 27017: This option tells nmap to scan only port 27017, which is commonly used by MongoDB.
-	The output tells that port 27017/tcp is open and that it is running MongoDB. However, nmap could not fully identify the version of MongoDB.
-	The scan also captured a series of HTTP-like responses, indicating that it could have identified a MongoDB REST API or other services associated with this port.
-	The result shows a successful connection to the MongoDB port but with limited information about the service version, suggesting that further probing or authenticated scanning might be necessary to fully identify the service.

![Build Information of Port 27017](img/ServiceBuild2.png)

#### Explanation:
-	**Build Information:**
-	Details about how MongoDB was compiled and configured:
    -   GCC version: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) 11.3.0 was used to build this MongoDB instance.
    -   MongoDB Build Options: Compilation flags like -fstack-protector-strong, -Wl,-z,now are visible, which provide insights into security measures like stack protection and memory management used during the build.
    - OpenSSL Version: The MongoDB instance uses OpenSSL 3.0.3 (March 2022), important for managing encrypted connections and security.
-   **Errors and Deprecated Commands:**
-   Several unsupported command errors are shown in the output:
    -    Error: Unsupported OP_QUERY command: serverStatus:
        -   The MongoDB server no longer supports the OP_QUERY for serverStatus. This suggests that MongoDB 7.0.14 has moved away from certain older commands used by the client or scanning tool.
    -   Error: Unsupported OP_QUERY command: listDatabases:
        -   Similarly, listDatabases is no longer supported via the legacy OP_QUERY command. This is related to changes in MongoDB's query protocol after version 4.2.
    -   These errors are accompanied by a message suggesting upgrading the client driver, and a link to the MongoDB documentation on legacy opcode removal for further clarification.
-   **Fingerprint Details:** The output includes HTTP-like fingerprinting strings showing attempts to access MongoDB over HTTP. However, these attempts fail, as MongoDB doesnâ€™t communicate directly via HTTP on the native driver port (port 27017).
-   The scan finished after 65.31 seconds, successfully identifying the service (MongoDB 7.0.14) and capturing the deprecated commands and build information.

### Detect vulnerabilities on port 27017:

![Finding Vulnerabilities on Port 27017](img/VulnerabilityScan.png)

#### Explanation:
-	--script vuln: Instructs nmap to run vulnerability scripts. These scripts attempt to detect known vulnerabilities on the specified service (in this case, MongoDB running on port 27017).
-	The scan checked port 27017 for any known vulnerabilities in MongoDB using the vuln script.
-	No vulnerabilities were detected or listed in the output for the MongoDB service running on the target machine.
-	This could indicate that MongoDB 7.0.14 is well-secured or that any potential vulnerabilities require more advanced methods to detect.

### Install mongodb-clients: 

![Installing MongoDb Clients](img/MongodbClients1.png)

![Installing MongoDb Clients](img/MongodbClients2.png)

-	Run a brute-force attack on the MongoDB service to check for weak credentials using the mongodb-brute script. This script tries multiple username/password combinations to see if the MongoDB instance has weak or default credentials that can be exploited to gain access.
- **How the mongodb-brute Script Works:**
    -	The mongodb-brute script is part of Nmap's scripting engine (NSE), specifically designed for brute-forcing MongoDB credentials.
    -	The script tests for a variety of default or common credentials (like admin:admin, root:password) and can be configured to use custom username/password lists if specified.
    -	If successful, it will report back which credentials were used to access the MongoDB instance, which could indicate a security vulnerability (weak password).But the scan didn't reveal any credentials for the MongoDB Service.

### Installing Docker:

![Installing Docker](img/InstallDocker.png)

-	Installing Docker gives a flexible and isolated environment where we can run MongoDB instances on port 27017. This setup will allow us to:
    -	Run MongoDB in a safe, controlled environment.
    -	Test MongoDB configurations against security threats (like weak authentication or misconfigurations).
    -	Experiment with different MongoDB versions or settings without risking the security of your main system.

### Start Docker:

- docker run --help, displaying a list of options and flags for running containers, such as detached mode (-d), port mapping (-p), and custom container naming (--name).

### Running MongoDB Container:

![Running the Mongodb Container](img/Container.png)

-	MongoDB Container Attempt: The first attempt involved running a MongoDB container using the mongo:latestimage (MongoDB 5.0) to connect to host 10.137.0.149 on port 27017.
-	Issue with MongoDB 5.0: The first attempt to pull mongo:latest (MongoDB 5.0) raised a compatibility warning:
-	CPU with AVX support is required: The system does not have a CPU that supports AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions), which is necessary for running MongoDB 5.0.
-	Switching to MongoDB 4.4: A second attempt pulled and used the mongo:4.4 image, which avoided the AVX compatibility issue.
-	MongoDB Shell and Server Versions: The MongoDB shell inside the container is version 4.4.29, while the server being connected to runs version 7.0.14, resulting in a version mismatch warning.
-	**Connection Established:** Despite the version mismatch, the connection to the MongoDB instance at 10.137.0.149:27017 was successfully established, allowing interaction with the server.

#### Connection Status:
The session is connected to the MongoDB server, but authentication failures and permission warnings are preventing full access to the databases or collections.

#### MongoDB's Security Posture:
- MongoDB 7.0.14 is a relatively recent release. The MongoDB development team actively maintains their software, so major vulnerabilities are typically addressed in newer versions.
Newer versions generally come with improved security features, making it harder to find vulnerabilities compared to older, unpatched versions.

### Conclusion:
To conclude, the process involved setting up and interacting with a MongoDB instance using Docker, while scanning port 27017 for vulnerabilities. Although a connection to MongoDB 7.0.14 was established, authentication attempts failed due to misconfigured credentials. MongoDB 7.0.14, being a recent version, is less likely to have easy-to-exploit vulnerabilities, but misconfigurations and poor security practices can still expose the database to risks. A security audit or penetration test should prioritize reviewing configuration issues, such as authentication, network access, and encryption, rather than focusing solely on known software vulnerabilities.
