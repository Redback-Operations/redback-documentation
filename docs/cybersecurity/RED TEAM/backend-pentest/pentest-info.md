# Pentesting Use Cases
The "What" and "Why's" of pentesting

## What is penetration testing?

It is a testing method that helps find vulnerabilities of a network, web application or computer system.
This testing method helps in identifying whether the existing defensive measures that are incorporated
in the system are enough to prevent any security breaches.

## Advantages of Pen Testing:

- **Adherence to Compliance Requirements**: Helps to meet regulatory requirements such as PCI
DSS, EU GDPR, and ISO.

- **Identify and Remediate Vulnerability**: Helps identify vulnerabilities that can exploit the
security systems and find a solution.

- **Ensure Business continuity**: By running pen tests, organizations can reduce the risk of attacks.

- **Enhance Customer Trust**: Pen testing can minimize the risk of attacks and assures clients that
their data is secure.

## Goals of Pen Testing:

- Check if web application can identify spam attacks on contact forms used on the website.

- Proxy server – Check if network traffic is monitored by proxy appliances. Proxy servers make it
difficult for hackers to get internal details of the network thus protecting the system from
external attacks.

- Spam email filters – Verify if incoming and outgoing email traffic is filtered and unsolicited
emails are blocked. Many email clients come with in-build spam filters which needs to be
configured as per needs. These configuration rules can be applied on email headers, subject,
or body. Can be identified by the keywords used in the subject line as well as the body.

- Firewall – Make sure entire network or computers are protected with Firewall.

- Verify that all usernames and passwords are encrypted and transferred over secured
connection like https.

- Verify information stored in website cookies. It should not be in readable format.

- Verify if there is no open port in network.

- Verify all HTTP methods. PUT and Delete methods should not be enabled on web server.

- Password monitoring (Using password with different combinations)

- Application behaviour after multiple logins and more activity of the user. (can be locked or
access can be retrieved).

-  Generation of Error messages in terms of invalid login details
   
-  Scan all incoming files uploaded by the users.
   
- Sensitive data should be hidden (Like invisible password)
   
- Blocking Login page after multiple failed attempts.
   
- Verification of reset password with double authentication (Email and Mobile)
   
- Relog in after the password is reset and logging out from different devices.
   
- Session ending after inactivity of user (Time limit of 15-30 mins).
   
- Maintaining of logs (User activity like login and logout).
   
- No redirection to third party websites

- Warning the user when public networks are used.

- GPS spoofing, Email ID spoofing, IP address spoofing, Caller ID spoofing, Referrer spoofing,
ARP spoofing etc., should be verified.

-  Monitor Trojan attacks by scanning incoming network traffic.

Expected Result: Proxy server should detect and block attempts to bypass, ensuring all traffic goes
through the proxy.

## Goal 3: Verify if incoming and outgoing email traffic is filtered.

Use Case: Spam Email Filters Verification

Test Case 1: Email Spoofing Attempt

Test Step: Send emails with spoofed headers, subjects, or bodies.

Expected Result: Spam filters should identify and block emails with suspicious content.

## Goal 4: Make sure entire network or computers are protected with Firewall.

Use Case: Firewall Protection Verification

Test Case 1: Port Scanning

Test Step: Conduct a port scan to identify open ports in the network.

Expected Result: Firewall should block unauthorized access through open ports and prevent
information of services on ports being sent.

## Goal 5: Verify that all usernames and passwords are encrypted and transferred securely.

Use Case: Secure User Authentication

Test Case 1: Login Credential Encryption

Test Step: Capture network traffic during login to verify that usernames and passwords are encrypted.

Expected Result: User credentials should be transmitted securely over HTTPS and/or other secure
protocols.

## Goal 6: Verify information stored in website cookies is not in readable format.

Use Case: Secure Cookie Storage

Test Case 1: Cookie Inspection

Test Step: Inspect cookies stored by the website to ensure they are not in a readable format.

Expected Result: Cookies should be encrypted or hashed for enhanced security.

## Goal 7: Verify if there is no open port in the network.

Use Case: Closed Port Verification

Test Case 1: Port Scanning

Test Step: Conduct a port scan to confirm that there are no open ports in the network.

Expected Result: All ports should be closed, except for essential services.

## Goal 8: Verify all HTTP methods; PUT and Delete methods should not be enabled on the web server.

Use Case: HTTP Method Verification

Test Case 1: PUT and Delete Method Test

Test Step: Attempt to use PUT and Delete methods on the web server.

Expected Result: PUT and Delete methods should be disabled, allowing only safe methods.

## Goal 9: Password monitoring (Using password with different combinations)

Use Case: Password Strength Testing

Test Case 1: Weak Password Attempt

Test Step: Attempt to use weak passwords, common passwords, and dictionary words.

Expected Result: The system should enforce password complexity and reject weak password attempts.

## Goal 10: Application behaviour after multiple logins and more user activity

Use Case: User Activity Monitoring

Test Case 1: Multiple Login Attempts

Test Step: Attempt multiple login sessions within a short timeframe.

Expected Result: System behaviour should be monitored, and any suspicious activity should be flagged
or restricted.

## Goal 11: Generation of error messages in terms of invalid login details

Use Case: Invalid Login Error Handling

Test Case 1: Invalid Login Attempt

Test Step: Attempt to log in with incorrect credentials.

Expected Result: The system should provide generic error messages without revealing specific details
about the invalid input.
