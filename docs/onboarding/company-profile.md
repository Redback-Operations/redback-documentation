### Projects

#### Project 1: VR Sun Cycle + Smart Bike Project

Product Owner: **Acting Company Director of Redback**

This project aims to revolutionize indoor exercise by merging Virtual Reality (VR) and Smart Bike
technologies, creating an immersive workout experience that transcends traditional fitness routines.
Initially conceived as two separate endeavours—SuncycleVR and the Smart Bike—these projects have
now been unified. The Smart Bike serves as an intuitive controller within the VR environment, with IoT
technology enabling real-time turning and movement based on the user's pedalling speed.

The integration of pedal rotations to control the virtual bike's speed marks a significant milestone in achieving a seamless, realistic exercise experience. Meanwhile, the VR component is under active development, with plans to expand beyond the existing starting zone and cityscape. Future updates aim to introduce challenging terrains, such as hills, to leverage the Smart Bike's incline feature, adding an extra layer of difficulty and resistance to workouts. In T1 the team Developed VR missions, integrated the smart bike with VR, and connected a mobile app to collect/show workout data from the Smart bike. 

Leadership for this ambitious project is divided among 5 senior members in Trimester 2 2024, each responsible for a distinct aspect of development: 

**Jonathan David Lowden** oversees VR interactions, task planning, and team coordination (Online). 

**Pratik Milind Pawar** and **Delia Chia Hui Kok** co-lead the project, both living on campus and inducted to the makers space where the smart bikes are located. 

**Ethan Byrne-Staunton** leads IoT integration, ensuring seamless communication between the Smart Bike, VR environment, and associated mobile app. 

**Dennis Yu** coordinates the design of VR environments and assets, crafting engaging and visually captivating design elements and updating asset guidelines and references images for the team. 
 
As the project progresses, the team is focused on enriching the VR experience with interactive missions and environments, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in virtual fitness.

#### Project 3: Athlete Wearable Tech (Previously Sports Performance Analysis)

Product Owner: **Acting Company Director of Redback**

The Athlete Wearables Tech initiative, previously known as the Sports Performance Analysis project, is dedicated to exploiting the vast potential of data derived from wearable technology in various sports. This pioneering project aims at augmenting athletic performance through detailed data analytics and advanced predictive modelling. By leveraging sophisticated tools such as Python and Power BI, the initiative delves deep into the essence of sports analytics, providing customised insights to enhance training and performance across diverse disciplines. The project recently focused on: 

An in-depth analysis of metrics like heart rate, speed, and distance is conducted to formulate bespoke training plans. These plans are meticulously tailored to meet each athlete's unique needs, taking into account variables such as age and health in the following solo sports. 

- Cycling 
- Running
- Swimming 

Central to this project is a commitment to refining predictive models, particularly in cycling, and expanding into refining running analytics and progress swimming analytics. Additionally, significant efforts are being made to develop a prototype web application. This application is envisioned not only as a repository for analysis and insights but also as a dynamic tool for planning and monitoring training and competition programs. It will enable athletes to upload their data, marrying personal performance metrics with wider analytical findings. 

As part of a comprehensive ecosystem dedicated to athlete data collection and analysis, this project presents a unique opportunity for collaboration with teams working on related initiatives, significantly extending the reach and impact of our efforts.
