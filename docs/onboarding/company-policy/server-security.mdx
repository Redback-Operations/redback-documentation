## Strategic Overview & Controls

The server security policy for Redback Operations is developed in line with the Australian Signals Directorate's Information Security Manual (ISM) and the Essential 8 Framework. It provides a holistic approach to safeguarding IT infrastructure against a broad spectrum of security threats.

This section of the Server Security Policy details key topics covered under these frameworks, and provides guidance and reasoning regarding adherence to security controls:

*We prioritize credential management and authentication to tightly control system access, ensuring that identity verification, random credential generation, secure distribution, enforced changes on first use, and prevention of credential reuse are all in place. These measures establish a strong foundation for managing both internal and external threats effectively.*

*Session and screen locking practices are incorporated to secure inactive sessions from unauthorized access. Automatic locking after inactivity, or when manually locked by users, ensures that active sessions are secure, and systems remain protected when temporarily unattended.*

*Logon practices are emphasized with logon banners to remind users of their security responsibilities and the sensitivity of the systems they handle. These practices reinforce a security-conscious mindset across the organization.*

*In virtualization and hypervisor hardening, we emphasize secure configurations, regular patching, and vendor selection based on secure-by-design principles to protect virtual environments just as rigorously as physical ones. This approach prevents attackers from exploiting virtualization vulnerabilities.*

*Functional separation between computing environments and server roles is an effective strategy to prevent breaches from spreading via lateral movement. By enforcing both physical and logical isolation and ensuring secure software-based isolation mechanisms, we protect the integrity of each computing environment independently.*

*The Essential 8 Framework strategies referenced in this Server Security policy include references to controls such as:*

-   *Application whitelisting*
-   *Regular patching of software and operating systems*
-   *Restricting administrative privileges*
-   *Multi-factor authentication*
-   *Application Hardening*
-   *Microsoft Office Macro Settings & Microsoft Security Baseline Policies*

*These strategies are chosen for their effectiveness in mitigating malware infections, minimizing the impact of security incidents, and enabling rapid data recovery.*

*Monitoring and log analytics are central to our continuous security assessment, aggregating and analysing logs from critical systems to detect potential security incidents swiftly. This proactive approach enhances threat detection while ensuring compliance and supporting forensic investigations.*

The strategies referenced in this policy form a comprehensive, layered defence to protect Redback Operations from evolving threats while aligning with national and international industry standards. Each control and strategy work cohesively to deliver proactive security measures that create a culture of security-consciousness and readiness.

### Application Management and Control

#### Application Management  
To minimize the risk posed by malicious applications, Redback Operations implements strict controls on application management:

-   Unprivileged users are not allowed to install unapproved software.
-   Approved software must be installed from organization-managed repositories or trusted application marketplaces.
-   Unprivileged users cannot uninstall or disable approved software, preventing the removal of security features or critical system functions.

#### Application Control  

Application control helps to prevent the execution of malicious code on servers. Redback Operations follows a structured approach to application control:

-   Develop rulesets based on business requirements, including specific executable, script, installer, and driver types.
-   Use cryptographic hash rules, publisher certificate rules, or path rules while ensuring hardening measures are in place.
-   Log and analyse application control events centrally to detect and investigate malicious behaviour.

#### Command Shell  

Command shells, while useful for automating system tasks, can be exploited by malicious actors. By centrally logging command line process creation events, Redback Operations can detect malicious behaviour promptly.

-   Command line process creation events are centrally logged.

#### PowerShell  

PowerShell is a powerful tool but can be dangerous if exploited. The following controls protect against unauthorized usage:

-   Disable or remove Windows PowerShell 2.0 to prevent attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in older versions.
-   Set PowerShell's language mode to Constrained Language Mode, balancing security with functionality.
-   Log PowerShell module, script block, and transcription events centrally to monitor the security posture and detect malicious actions.
-   Protect PowerShell script block logs using Protected Event Logging.
-   Ensure PowerShell remote execution policy is configured to use RemoteSigned.

### Intrusion Prevention, Software Firewalls, Antivirus, and Device Access Control

#### Host-Based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)  
Signature-based detection can miss new variants of malware. A Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) uses behaviour-based detection to identify and block malicious activity, providing an extra layer of security for both workstations and critical servers at Redback Operations.

#### Software Firewall  
Network firewalls generally control communication between network segments based on ports and protocols but often fail to prevent malware propagation or data exfiltration. Software firewalls offer more granular control, allowing communication restrictions based on specific applications or services, effectively safeguarding servers, and workstations.

#### Antivirus Software  
Malicious actors frequently reuse known vulnerabilities, and antivirus software on workstations and servers provides protection by leveraging signature-based, heuristic, and reputation-rating detection. Regular scanning and timely updates reduce the risk of exploitation.

#### Device Access Control Software  
External communication interfaces that facilitate Direct Memory Access (DMA) or removable media can be exploited if improperly managed, posing significant security risks. Device access control software or disabling external interfaces minimizes the risk.

#### Control References

-   ISM-1034: Implement a HIPS on critical and high-value servers.

### Microsoft Office Macros

Microsoft Office macros are written in Visual Basic for Applications and can automate tasks, enhancing productivity. However, macros can be exploited by malicious actors to compromise systems. Therefore, Redback Operations enforces strict controls over macro usage to minimize risks.

-   Disable Microsoft Office macros for users who lack a demonstrated business need.
-   Prevent macros in Microsoft Office files originating from the internet.
-   Enable Microsoft Office macro antivirus scanning.
-   Stop Microsoft Office macros from making Win32 API calls.
-   Allow macros only if they run within a sandboxed environment, Trusted Location, or are signed by a trusted publisher.
-   Verify macros are free from malicious code before signing or placing them in Trusted Locations.
-   Limit modification rights to Trusted Location content to privileged users responsible for macro verification.
-   Block macros signed by untrusted publishers or those using non-V3 signatures via the Message Bar or Backstage View.
-   Validate Microsoft Office’s list of trusted publishers annually or more frequently.

### Server Application Hardening

#### Server Applications

This section covers applications with specific server functionality, such as Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), database management systems, email servers, and web hosting software.

**Note: User applications are covered under user application hardening.**

#### Server Application Selection

Selecting server applications from vendors that follow secure-by-design and secure-by-default principles is critical to minimizing vulnerabilities. Vendors should also use memory-safe programming languages (C\#, Go, Java, Ruby, Rust, Swift) and maintain secure programming practices. Redback Operations should prioritize vendors that:

-   Follow secure-by-design and secure-by-default principles.
-   Use memory-safe programming languages where possible (C\#, Go, Java, Ruby, Rust, Swift).
-   Maintain secure programming practices and product security.

#### Server Application Releases

Newer server application releases include improved security features that complicate exploitation by malicious actors. Using unsupported versions leaves organizations exposed to previously mitigated vulnerabilities.

#### Hardening Server Application Configurations

Default or unapproved configurations can lead to an insecure environment, making server applications prime targets for exploitation. Redback Operations should:

-   Develop, implement, and maintain approved configurations for server applications.
-   Use ASD and vendor guidance for hardening, prioritizing the most restrictive advice in case of conflicts.
-   Modify default accounts or credentials, including pre-configured accounts.
-   Disable or remove unneeded accounts, components, services, and features.
-   Remove installation files and logs once applications are fully installed.

#### Restricting Privileges for Server Applications

If a server application runs as a local administrator or root account, it can pose a significant security risk. Applications should:

-   Configure server applications to run as separate accounts with the minimum privileges needed.
-   Restrict the file system access of accounts under which server applications run.

#### Control References

-   ISM-1826: Choose server applications from vendors committed to secure principles and practices.
-   ISM-1483: Use the latest release of internet-facing server applications.
-   ISM-1916: Develop and maintain approved configurations.

<div style={{height: '4px', width: '100%', background: '#FFA500', margin: '20px 0'}}></div>

### Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Hardening

Microsoft AD DS Domain Controllers  
Microsoft AD DS domain controllers contain highly sensitive data, including hashed credentials. Dedicated domain administrator accounts should be exclusively used for AD DS management, ensuring they can't be used to administer other systems.

-   Disable the Print Spooler service on these controllers.
-   Avoid using passwords in Group Policy Preferences
-   Centrally log security events.

#### Microsoft AD DS Account Hardening  

Misconfigured accounts pose a significant security risk. Malicious actors can gain access to AD DS and move laterally throughout the network. Redback Operations mitigates these risks by implementing the following guidelines:

-   Only configure service and computer accounts with Service Principal Names (SPNs).
-   Ensure service accounts have minimal privileges and exclude them from the domain administrators’ group.
-   Prevent duplicate SPNs within the domain.
-   Configure privileged accounts as sensitive and prevent delegation.
-   Require user accounts to use Kerberos pre-authentication.
-   Password Management:
    -   Don't use "password never expires" or "password not required" settings.
    -   Avoid storing passwords in properties accessible to unprivileged users.
    -   Don't use reversible encryption.
-   Domain Access Control:
    -   Prevent unprivileged users from adding machines to the domain.
    -   Use dedicated service accounts for adding machines.
-   Review user accounts with unconstrained delegation annually and remove those lacking a business requirement.
-   Prevent non-domain controller computer accounts from being trusted for delegation.

<div style={{height: '4px', width: '100%', background: '#FFA500', margin: '20px 0'}}></div>

### Microsoft AD DS Security Group Memberships  

Built-in security groups have elevated permissions that can be exploited. Limit vulnerabilities by ensuring:

-   Privileged accounts are members of the Protected Users group.
-   Remove disabled accounts from security groups.
-   Ensure no user accounts are part of the Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access group.

#### Control References

-   ISM-1827: Administer AD DS using dedicated domain administrator accounts.
-   ISM-1828: Disable the Print Spooler service on AD DS domain controllers.

<div style={{height: '4px', width: '100%', background: '#FFA500', margin: '20px 0'}}></div>

### Authentication Hardening

#### Account and Authentication Types

These guidelines apply to all account types, including unprivileged, privileged, break glass, and service accounts, covering both interactive and non-interactive authentication.

#### Authenticating to Systems

Users must be authenticated before gaining access to a system and its resources. This can be achieved via multi-factor authentication (MFA), such as a username with a passphrase and security key, or through single-factor authentication (SFA) as a less secure alternative.

-   Authenticate users before granting system access.

#### Insecure Authentication Methods

Authentication methods must resist theft, interception, duplication, forgery, unauthorized access, and modification. Weak hashing algorithms in Local Area Network (LAN) Manager and NT LAN Manager (NTLM) can be easily compromised. Disable these protocols and use Kerberos for Windows authentication.

-   Disable authentication methods susceptible to replay attacks.
-   Disable LAN Manager and NTLM authentication methods.

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA uses two or more factors to confirm user identity:

-   Knowledge Factors: Memorized secrets (e.g., PINs, passwords).
-   Possession Factors: Security keys, smart cards, or OTP tokens.
-   Inherence Factors: Biometric data (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition).

MFA is vital for administrative activities, online services, privileged accounts, and data repositories. It helps slow down or prevent attackers from gaining unrestricted access. Key points include:

-   Ensure MFA used for authenticating online services, data repositories, and systems is phishing resistant.
-   Log successful and unsuccessful MFA events centrally.

#### Single-Factor Authentication

Single-factor authentication (SFA) remains vulnerable to credential cracking tools. If multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not supported, use SFA with strong passphrases. Key recommendations include:

-   Use passphrases consisting of at least four random words (or longer, depending on classification level).
-   Avoid categorically predictable words, meaningful sentences, or publicly available material.
-   Log successful and unsuccessful SFA events centrally to detect malicious behaviour.

#### Setting Credentials for User Accounts

Ensure credentials for user accounts are securely issued and managed:

-   Verify the user's identity before issuing new credentials.
-   Credentials should be randomly generated.
-   Provide credentials via a secure channel or split into two parts (user and supervisor).
-   Ensure users change credentials on first use.
-   Prevent users from reusing memorized credentials across systems.

#### Setting Credentials for Break Glass, Local Administrator, and Service Accounts

Common usernames or weak credentials can lead to rapid exploitation of break glass, local administrator, and service accounts. Secure these accounts by following these guidelines:

-   Ensure credentials are long (at least 30 characters), unique, and unpredictable.
-   Use Microsoft's group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) to automatically manage service account credentials.
-   Credentials for break glass, local administrator, and service accounts are long, unique, and managed.
-   Credentials for these accounts are a minimum of 30 characters.
-   Create service accounts as group Managed Service Accounts.

#### Changing Credentials

Credentials typically do not require frequent changes unless specific conditions arise:

-   Update credentials when compromised, suspected of compromise, stored/transferred in the clear, shared account membership changes, or when not changed in 12 months.
-   Change KRBTGT credentials twice if the domain is compromised, suspected of compromise, or if not updated in 12 months.

#### Protecting Credentials

Protect credentials by following these guidelines:

-   Keep credentials separate from systems they authenticate to unless used for authentication activities.
-   Conceal credentials as they are entered into systems to prevent screen scrapers and shoulder surfers.
-   Use memory integrity, Local Security Authority, Credential Guard, and Remote Credential Guard functionality, preferably with UEFI lock.
-   Limit cached credentials to one previous logon.
-   Protect credentials with a password manager, hardware security module, or by hashing, salting, and stretching them before storage in a database.
-   Regularly scan networks to identify and remediate credentials stored in the clear.

#### Account Lockouts

Locking accounts after several failed attempts reduces the success rate of brute-force attacks like credential guessing or spraying. Implement these practices:

-   Lock accounts (except break glass) after a maximum of five failed logon attempts.

#### Session Termination

Terminating user sessions daily and after inactivity supports system maintenance and helps remove malicious actors lacking persistence.

#### Session and Screen Locking

Session and screen locks prevent unauthorized access to authenticated sessions. Key requirements include:

-   Activate after 15 minutes of inactivity or when manually triggered.
-   Ensure session content is concealed and the screen does not enter power-saving mode before locking.
-   Require users to authenticate to unlock.
-   Deny users the ability to disable the screen lock.

#### Logon Banner

A logon banner reminds users of security responsibilities when accessing systems. Include:

-   System sensitivity/classification, access requirements, usage policies, and monitoring activities.

### Virtualization Hardening

#### Hypervisors

Both Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors must be treated according to their role:

-   Type 1 Hypervisors: Run on bare metal and should be treated as lightweight operating systems.
-   Type 2 Hypervisors: Run on top of general-purpose operating systems and should be treated as applications.

#### Containerization

Containers offer versatile deployment but must be managed like any system.

-   Applying patches and ensuring patched images are used is crucial.

#### Functional Separation Between Computing Environments

Malicious actors can exploit misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in software-based isolation mechanisms to compromise multiple environments. Key practices include:

-   Choose isolation mechanism vendors following secure-by-design and secure-by-default principles while maintaining product security.
-   Restrict administrative access and remove unnecessary functionality from isolation mechanisms.
-   Secure the underlying operating system through comprehensive hardening.
-   Promptly apply patches, updates, and mitigations for both the isolation mechanism and underlying OS.
-   Replace outdated isolation mechanisms and OS software.
-   Perform integrity and log monitoring for both isolation mechanisms and underlying OS.
-   Physical servers used for SECRET and TOP SECRET computing environments should only host environments of the same classification and security domain.

#### Control References:

-   ISM-1460: Select isolation mechanisms from secure vendors.
-   ISM-1604: Harden isolation mechanisms and restrict administrative access.
-   ISM-1605: Harden the underlying OS.
-   ISM-1606: Apply patches, updates, and mitigations promptly.
-   ISM-1848: Replace isolation mechanisms and OS when unsupported.
-   ISM-1607: Monitor integrity and logs of isolation mechanisms and OS.
-   ISM-1461: Use servers of the same classification/security domain for SECRET/TS environments.

## Policy Review

The objective of this policy review section is to ensure that the security controls and guidelines within the Server Security Policy remain relevant, effective, and aligned with evolving security threats, organizational needs, and compliance requirements.

**Note: Company layout and infrastructure does not reflect the standards outline in this policy at the time of this document’s creation and is considered a long-term strategy to implement when company maturity has improved.**

### Responsibility for Reviews

The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is designated as the primary initiator of the reviews for the cyber security policy at Redback Operations. A review committee assists in evaluating the effectiveness and relevance of the policy.

### Frequency of Reviews

Reviews are scheduled to occur at least annually. However, more frequent reviews are conducted if there are significant changes in technology, business practices, or compliance requirements. Ad-hoc reviews are also permitted in response to security incidents or major failures in the existing policy.

### Proposing and Approving Changes

Any member of the review committee can propose changes during the review process. These proposals should be supported by a rationale and, where possible, data to substantiate the change. After a thorough discussion within the committee, the CISO presents the proposed changes to senior management for approval.

### Communication Plan for Updates

Once changes are approved, the updated policy is communicated to all stakeholders through internal memos, meetings, and training sessions. All employees must understand the changes and how they impact their roles and responsibilities. Regular training sessions are updated to reflect the new policy standards.
