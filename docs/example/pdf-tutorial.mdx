# Embedding PDFs Into Pages


:::danger[Important!]

Please view the source code of this file on
[Github](https://github.com/Redback-Operations/redback-documentation/blob/main/docs/example/pdf-tutorial.mdx) to see how it's done!

:::

## How-to

### Check your file types!

For embedding PDFs to work, please ensure:

1. It is actually a PDF file.

2. Ensure that your documentation file is a **`.mdx`** file **rather than** a **`.md`** file. This
is due to **`.mdx`** supporting small amounts of HTML, CSS, JS, and React, of which some HTML
is used here. (this also means you can do other cool things too if you want!).


### Hosting the file

Typically when files such as PDFs are uploaded to this build, their names are converted
to a random string in order to avoid duplication. However, we can bypass this.

To do so, save your PDF in the **`static/pdf`** folder. Ensure the document has a unique
name.

Once deployed, the file will have the URL **`https://redback-operations.github.io/redback-documentation/pdf/<file name.pdf>`**

The `<file name.pdf>` (which you need to replace!) is **case sensitive**.

This cannot be tested locally, so please ensure the URL is correct before putting in the
pull request, and also check after an approver has deployed the live site in case there is an
issue.


### Adding the PDF to the pages

Now the fun part! However, once again, this cannot be tested locally so please ensure you
follow the steps correctly.

On your **`.mdx`** file, after you have set the page up (see [page setup tutorial](tutorial) and
[companion video](https://youtu.be/AbDBXuXaJ_s)), copy and paste the below code where relevant
on your page, ensuring you replace the URL with that you created in the previous step.

```
<embed
      src="https://redback-operations.github.io/redback-documentation/pdf/<file>.pdf"
      type="application/pdf"
      width="100%"
      height="800px"
/>
```

`800px` height is recommended, but this can be changed if needed.

## Voilà!

And you're done! Below is an example of how it looks embedded. As always, please review the code
of this file if you need guidance of how to create a markdown file, do so by creating your own
fork of [the repo](https://github.com/Redback-Operations/redback-documentation/blob/main/docs/example/pdf-tutorial.mdx).
