<!-- -->Ride, Race, and Conquer Reality in SmartBike VR: Where Your Pedals Power Your Adventure</p>
<p>&quot;SmartBike VR&quot; is a virtual reality experience designed to gamify cycling and encourage physical exercise. The game integrates a seamless system of linking smart indoor exercise bikes, currently limited to Wahoo KICKR Core/Climb, with a Unity-built game for controlling the in-game cycling experience and supports Meta Quest 2/3 for immersive VR gameplay. The game also offers a synchronized view on both VR headsets and external monitors, providing a dynamic and engaging experience for both players and spectators. Multiplayer support is provided through Photon Fusion, letting players cycle and compete in a shared virtual world.</p>

<p>The SmartBike VR system is built for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fitness enthusiasts who are looking to gamify their exercise routines</li>
<li>Casual gamers who are interested in health and wellness</li>
<li>Competitive cyclists seeking a virtual training environment</li>
<li>VR gamers looking for an immersive and active experience</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Meta Quest 2/3</strong>:<br>
<!-- -->&quot;SmartBike VR&quot; is targetted specifically at the Meta Quest headsets and their ability to communicate wirelessly with a physical bike. It allows the player to install the game on their headset, connect to their bike over bluetooth and then explore a virtual world in the comfort of their own home.</p>
<p><strong>SteamVR</strong>:<br>
<!-- -->&quot;SmartBike VR&quot; can be used in a tethered mode for PC gaming platforms which utilizes SteamVR as the technology framework to enable virtual reality gameplay. The tethered mode will allow for a simultaneous VR experience, but also be able to remove the headset and experience the game in an onscreen mode. This means that players who own compatible VR headsets and use the Steam platform could access and play &quot;SmartBike VR&quot; through the SteamVR platform.</p>
<p><strong>PlayStation (PS4, PS5)</strong>:<br>
<!-- -->With the PS4/PS5 both having a PSVR system, expanding &quot;SmartBike VR&quot; for PlayStation consoles (PS4 and PS5) can capitalize on the platform&#x27;s extensive player base, spanning casual gamers to enthusiasts, and its well-established VR support through PlayStation VR. With millions of users and the potential for diverse demographics, the game can attract a broad audience. That the PlayStation also utilizes bluetooth connectivity, the ability to connect wirelessly to your physical bike is still able to occur and add that virtual workout to your PlayStation gaming experience.</p>

<p>Embark on an immersive journey of adventure and fitness in &#x27;SmartBike VR.&#x27; Pedal your way through an expansive VR world, where your stationary cycling powers the action. Engage in thrilling races across diverse landscapes, embrace the challenge of delivery quests in a free roam map, and collect valuable data using integrated sensors. With the power of VR, &#x27;SmartBike VR&#x27; invites players of all backgrounds to experience the fusion of gaming and exercise, while the potential for console platforms like PlayStation and Xbox ensures a broad reach, promising a new era of interactive and healthy entertainment.</p>

<p>Subscription model with a free-to-play mode.</p>
<p>&quot;SmartBike VR&quot; will be available through the Steam Store, Meta Store and directly on a Meta Quest headset. It will be available to download for free with a basic version allowing the player to experience the game without a cost. If further content is wanted to be experienced, this will be done as a pay-to-play model with a small monthly cost.

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="21-core-pillar-of-gameplay">2.1. Core Pillar of Gameplay<a href="#21-core-pillar-of-gameplay" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.1. Core Pillar of Gameplay" title="Direct link to 2.1. Core Pillar of Gameplay">​</a></h3>
<p>&quot;Physical Engagement&quot; as a core pillar of gameplay in &quot;SmartBike VR&quot; revolves around the active involvement of players&#x27; physical movements to control their in-game avatars and impact their performance. This gameplay is central to the game&#x27;s concept of combining exercise with virtual reality gaming.</p>
<p>Players use their real bicycles, equipped with sensors, to simulate cycling within the virtual world. As players pedal on their stationary bikes, their movements are translated into in-game actions, allowing them to control the speed and direction of their avatars. Pedaling speed determines the avatar&#x27;s movement speed in the virtual environment. Players can control the direction of their avatar by steering the handlebars of their real bicycle.</p>
<p>Just like in real cycling, players need to manage their energy levels. Pedaling faster consumes more energy, while slowing down conserve’s energy. This dynamic encourages players to strategize when to speed up and when to maintain a steady pace. Players can use their physical engagement to strategically navigate races. For example, they might pedal intensely during a sprint challenge and then ease up during downhill sections to recover energy.</p>
<p>The physical engagement element adds a layer of challenge to navigating obstacles within the virtual world. Players need to adjust their pedaling intensity and direction to avoid obstacles and hazards effectively. The more players engage physically, the more they can improve their fitness levels and in-game skills. Regular physical activity can result in better performance, faster completion times, and increased stamina. By intertwining physical movement with gameplay, &quot;SmartBike VR&quot; serves as a motivational tool for exercise. Players are encouraged to stay active while enjoying a virtual cycling experience.</p>
<p>Physical engagement aligns with the game&#x27;s focus on promoting a healthier lifestyle. Players can experience cardiovascular exercise, improved stamina, and other health benefits while having fun. Physical engagement enhances the immersion by making players feel more connected to the virtual world. It also offers a unique way for players to interact with the game environment.</p>
<p>Different types of challenges, such as sprints, endurance races, and hill climbs, provide players with varied gameplay experiences that require adjusting their physical engagement strategies.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="22-multiplayer-features">2.2. Multiplayer Features<a href="#22-multiplayer-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.2. Multiplayer Features" title="Direct link to 2.2. Multiplayer Features">​</a></h3>
<p>In &quot;SmartBike VR&quot;, players can join live cycling events, races, or group rides in real-time, where Photon Fusion ensures smooth multiplayer gameplay with minimal latency. This allows participants to experience real-time interactions with other players, simulating the feel of riding alongside each other, whether they&#x27;re racing head-to-head or engaging in a leisurely group ride. Photon Fusion’s efficient networking is key to providing this seamless multiplayer environment, minimizing lag even with multiple players connected simultaneously.</p>
<p>Player performance is tracked using various metrics, such as time, distance, and calories burned, all of which can be displayed on a real-time leaderboard. This ranking system adds a competitive edge, encouraging players to push themselves harder and improve their results. The system could also highlight personal achievements and improvements over time, motivating users to stay engaged.</p>
<p>In addition to competitive racing, the game offers cooperative challenges.

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="23-synchronized-view">2.3. Synchronized View<a href="#23-synchronized-view" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.3. Synchronized View" title="Direct link to 2.3. Synchronized View">​</a></h3>
<p>In &quot;SmartBike VR&quot;, both the player in VR and spectators watching on an external monitor can enjoy a highly immersive and engaging experience through synchronized views. While the player navigates the virtual world from a first-person perspective, feeling as if they’re truly riding a bike, the external monitor offers an alternate viewing experience, such as a third-person camera or dynamic angles that showcase the player’s environment and progress from a broader perspective.</p>
<p>On the monitor, a comprehensive HUD (Heads-Up Display) enhances the spectator experience by providing detailed cycling stats. This could include real-time metrics like speed, heart rate, calories burned, and power output, offering viewers insight into the player’s physical exertion. The player’s position in the race or event, along with the overall progress of the ride, can also be displayed, showing lap times, remaining distance, and the positions of other competitors or teammates.</p>
<p>For an added layer of immersion, the camera angle could dynamically shift to highlight key moments in the race. For example, during close competition between players, the camera could zoom in on head-to-head sprints or critical overtaking moments. Alternatively, for longer endurance events, the camera might switch to a bird’s-eye view, giving spectators a clearer view of the terrain, track layout, and rider positions.</p>
<p>This dual view system allows for engaging live streams or in-person events where spectators can cheer on their favorite players, track their progress, and witness the virtual environment in ways that aren’t limited to the player’s VR perspective. By combining the VR experience with detailed stats and race updates on the monitor, you can create a more inclusive and informative environment for both participants and audiences, making the game not only immersive for the player but also compelling for those watching.</p>
