# Firebase overview 

:::warning
As of T3-24 firebase connectivity must be reimplemented if it is to be used at all. 
There was some discussion with the data warehouse team about them setting up an API to pipe data from the device securely but that got upended 
by both parties becoming busy with other problems.

For our project we are using Firebase for the data storage, currently we are using a Realtime database which will have to be replaced moving forward.
I have provided a video link that contains just the basic info on our databse such as the the login id and passwords to use firebase.
