## Overview
This project focuses on detecting and tracking greyhounds in races. Using YOLOv8 for object detection and tracking, the system highlights all the dogs in each video frame by putting a bounding box around them or identifying their number. Additionally, it calculates their relative speeds.

## Features
- **Greyhound Detection:** Accurately detects and identifies all greyhounds in each video frame.
- **Tracking and Sorting:** Tracks the positions of the greyhounds throughout the race.
- **Bounding Boxes:** Draws consistent bounding boxes around detected greyhounds.
- **Speed Calculation:** Calculates the relative speed of each greyhound in the race, though further refinement is needed.
- **Custom Dataset:** Created and labeled a large custom dataset using Roboflow, with tasks distributed among team members for efficient data labeling.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Ultralytics
- OpenCV
- Keras
- Graphviz
- Pydot

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rissicay/redback-orion
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Download the Dataset:**
    - Use the [Roboflow dataset link](https://app.roboflow.com/ds/TYmihJNfyP?key=D4ylby1lBR) to download the training data.
4. **Setup YOLOv8:**
    - Follow the [YOLOv8 installation guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) to set up the detection model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model includes a large collection of images of greyhounds, labeled and annotated using Roboflow. The dataset was created by the team, with tasks distributed among members to efficiently label each image, ensuring a high-quality dataset to improve the model's performance.

## Challenges Faced
- **Close Proximity Detection:** Initial challenges included difficulties in detecting greyhounds when they were close together. This was mitigated by expanding the dataset and refining the model.
- **Obstruction Issues:** Detecting greyhounds behind railings or other obstacles required additional training data and fine-tuning of the model.
- **Speed Calculation:** The speed feature was added to the system, but it requires further refinement to ensure accurate measurements.
- **Dataset Management:** Creating and labeling a large dataset involved coordination among team members to ensure consistency and accuracy.

## Future Work
- **Further Model Refinement:** Continue refining the model to enhance accuracy and robustness.
- **Speed Feature Improvement:** Improve the speed calculation feature for more accurate real-time tracking.
- **Automated Testing Pipeline:** Implement an automated testing pipeline to validate the model against new datasets.
- **Extended Features:** Explore adding features such as live commentaries.
