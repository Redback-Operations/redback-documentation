    "# Documentation: Creating Dynamic Dashboards with Power BI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Power BI is a powerful business intelligence tool from Microsoft that enables data visualization,  \n",
    "analysis, and reporting. This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to create and use  \n",
    "dynamic dashboards like the visualizations provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Importing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click \"Get Data\" and select your data source (Excel, CSV, SQL, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load your dataset and ensure data types are correctly identified (e.g., Date fields, numerical  \n",
    "  data) or if you want to transform the data, click on Transform data and write your  \n",
    "  transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 1 - Transform Data](powerbi/Picture3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After transforming click on close and apply  \n",
    "Now , we can start creating visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adding a new Column:**  \n",
    "Go to the table view and click on the new column it will allow you to create a new column\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 2 - Add New Column](power_bi/powerbi/Picture4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Creating Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pie Chart:**\n",
    "  - Select Pie Chart from the visualization pane.\n",
    "  - Drag \"Day\" to Legend and \"First Time Visits\" to Values.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 3 - Pie Chart](powerbi/Picture5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bar Charts:**\n",
    "  - Select Bar Chart from the visualization pane.\n",
    "  - Drag \"Day\" to Axis and \"First Time Visits\" or \"Returning Visits\" to Values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can select the measure, we want to see on bar graph by clicking on y axis and  \n",
    "another visual by new visual\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 4 - Bar Chart](powerbi/Picture6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Line Charts (Trends Over Time):**\n",
    "  - Select Line Chart from the visualization pane.\n",
    "  - Drag \"Year\" or \"Month\" to Axis and measures such as \"First Time Visits,\" \"Returning  \n",
    "    Visits,\" or \"Unique Visits\" to Values.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 5 - Line Chart](powerbi/Picture8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Applying Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the \"Filters\" pane to dynamically interact with your dashboard.\n",
    "- Apply filters by dragging fields into the \"Filters on this page\" or \"Filters on all pages\" sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 6 - Filters](powerbi/Picture9.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Creating Dynamic Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select any visual on your report canvas.\n",
    "- Then go to the \"Format\" tab on the ribbon at the top (visible when a visual is selected).\n",
    "- Click \"Edit interactions\". This enables options on all visuals to control how each one responds  \n",
    "  to the selected visual (highlight, filter, or none).\n",
    "- Clicking on a segment in one visual dynamically updates others based on related data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 7 - Edit Interactions](powerbi/Picture10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Creating a Truly Dynamic Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dynamic dashboard in Power BI:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use slicers for fields like \"Date\", \"Category\", or \"Location\" so users can filter data  \n",
    "  dynamically.\n",
    "- Create measures with DAX that change based on user inputs or slicer values (e.g., dynamic  \n",
    "  titles, dynamic KPIs).\n",
    "- Utilize Bookmarks and Buttons to switch between different views or toggle filters.\n",
    "- Leverage drill-through pages for users to click on data points and view deeper details.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques ensure your dashboard is not just static but interactive, customizable, and user-  \n",
    "friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Publishing Dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click \"Publish\" to upload the dashboard to the Power BI Service, making it accessible online  \n",
    "  and interactive for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps and guidelines, you can effectively use Power BI to create dynamic,  \n",
    "interactive dashboards, empowering insights and decision-making.\n",
