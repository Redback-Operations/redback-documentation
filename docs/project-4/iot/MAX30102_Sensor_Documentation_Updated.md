## Arduino Code Example

This sample Arduino code demonstrates how to set up and read data from the MAX30102 sensor using the DFRobot_BloodOxygen_S library.

```cpp
#include "DFRobot_BloodOxygen_S.h"

// Define the I2C address for the MAX30102 sensor
#define I2C_ADDRESS 0x57

// Create an instance of the DFRobot_BloodOxygen_S_I2C class for I2C communication
DFRobot_BloodOxygen_S_I2C MAX30102(&Wire, I2C_ADDRESS);

void setup() {
  // Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 115200
  Serial.begin(115200);

  // Attempt to initialize the MAX30102 sensor
  while (false == MAX30102.begin()) {
    Serial.println("init fail!");
    delay(1000);
  }

  Serial.println("init success!");
  Serial.println("start measuring...");
  MAX30102.sensorStartCollect();
}

void loop() {
  // Retrieve the heartbeat and SPO2 data from the sensor
  MAX30102.getHeartbeatSPO2();
  Serial.print("SPO2 is : ");
  Serial.print(MAX30102._sHeartbeatSPO2.SPO2);
  Serial.println("%");

  // Delay for 4 seconds before the next read
  delay(4000);
}
```
