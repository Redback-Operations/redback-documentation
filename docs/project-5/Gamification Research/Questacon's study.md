Questacon offers a range of interactive games designed to engage visitors in science and technology learning. These games are crafted to be educational, fun, and accessible, providing hands-on experiences that align with STEM education goals. Below is a detailed report on the available games and how their features can be useful for implementing in Bugbox, a project aimed at integrating technology in classrooms.

The games that are offered by Questacon are mentioned below: 

**Cyber Team Red:** UnityCo Mission: This game involves players taking on the roles of cyber experts to complete a series of missions. It includes five stages: receiving mission objectives, gathering information, executing the mission, safely exiting, and reviewing the mission's success.

**Cyber Castle Challenge:** This game teaches cybersecurity concepts through four seasons, each introducing new challenges. Players learn to protect assets, defend against evolving threats, manage a growing network, and verify identities. It is designed for groups of up to four students and includes resources for teachers to integrate it into the Australian Curriculum.

**Journey through the Science Garden:** An outdoor activity that combines exploration with learning about scientific concepts, encouraging curiosity and discovery in a natural setting.

**The Bot, the Legend: RoboQ:** An interactive exhibit focused on robotics, allowing participants to engage with robotic systems and learn about their real-world applications.

**Making Bush Soap:** A hands-on activity where participants learn about chemistry and traditional practices by making soap using natural ingredients, highlighting the intersection of science and culture.

## Graphic Designing Aspect 

**Exhibition Design:** Questacon's exhibits often feature custom illustrations and design elements that are both educational and visually engaging. Designers like Alicia Constantine and studios such as Inklab have contributed to creating award-winning artwork for Questacon. The designs often draw inspiration from historical illustrations, such as those by Heath Robinson, known for depicting complex and whimsical machinery.

**Unique Logos:** Each exhibition at Questacon is given a distinct identity through unique logos. These logos are carefully crafted to reflect the theme and narrative of the exhibition, with John Richardson playing a key role in their development.

**Technological Integration:** The Exhibit Design and Development team at Questacon uses advanced computer graphics systems, like the Apple Macintosh, to create detailed and precise exhibit designs. This technological integration allows for more sophisticated and interactive displays.

**Collaborative and Cultural Elements:** Questacon collaborates with organizations like Geoscience Australia to develop graphic exhibitions that use visual imagery, such as satellite data, to educate visitors. Additionally, Questacon incorporates cultural elements into its exhibits, such as a mural themed around the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, created by local graffiti artists, and collaborations with Indigenous communities to blend traditional knowledge with modern technology.
