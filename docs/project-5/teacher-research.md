## Research Overview
My research explored teachers’ interaction with BugBox, focusing on their views on incorporating robotics in classrooms. This research aimed to understand how BugBox can support teachers in enhancing the educational experience and fostering engagement among primary school students. I conducted interviews, distributed questionnaires, and evaluated teacher feedback to understand the integration challenges and benefits. Additionally, I explored their perspective on using robotics as part of a STEM curriculum.

### Interview with a Teacher
I conducted a one-on-one interview with a teacher to gather more in-depth information. The interview touched on the teacher's perspective on using BugBox in a classroom environment and their thoughts on how robotics can impact learning. The teacher expressed positive views on robotics, particularly on how it can make subjects like STEM more engaging and accessible. However, they highlighted the need for better professional development and simple, easy-to-use interfaces to reduce the learning curve for both teachers and students. This aligns with my research conclusions on improving the BugBox platform.
Here are the key questions and summarized responses:

#### General Perspective on Robotics in Education

1. How do you feel about the integration of robotics in school curriculums?
- Great for extension students
- Engages students with hands-on manipulatives in learning
- Encourages and exposes students to STEM-based skills, problem-solving, creativity, and teamwork

2. Do you think robotics can positively impact student learning and engagement? Why or why not?
- Yes, for the following reasons:
    - Hands-on learning that caters to multiple learning styles
    - Challenges problem-solving skills, building resilience
    - Enhances engagement, motivation, and collective efficacy among peers
    - Supports interdisciplinary learning by exposing students to STEM concepts
3. How important do you believe it is for students to learn about robotics at an early age?

- Fairly beneficial for the following reasons:
- Develops problem-solving abilities
- Provides exposure to STEM
- Encourages creativity
- Challenges cognitive and fine motor skills
- Fosters teamwork and adaptation to technology

#### Practical Applications and Classroom Experience
4. Have you ever used robotics or technology-based learning tools in your classroom? If so, how did your students respond to them?
- Not much, but we use a coding program similar to Scratch for senior students
- Most students enjoy coding, but some become frustrated if they can't progress

5. What challenges do you think teachers might face when implementing robotics in their lessons?
- Self-confidence in the product and content
- Troubleshooting challenges faced by students
- Varying skill levels and emotional regulation among students
- Extra organization and preparation work
- Technical issues, resource constraints, and classroom management

6. In what ways do you think robotics could enhance or complement traditional teaching methods?
- Provides hands-on learning and interactive engagement
- Connects students to real-world careers
- Promotes problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity
- Enables differentiated instruction for all learners

#### Curriculum and Student Development
7. How do you think learning robotics can contribute to students' overall development, including critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity?
- Critical thinking is enhanced through solving problems
- Early exposure to obstacles strengthens problem-solving skills
- Students can design and modify robots, providing motivation and extension challenges for advanced learners

8. Do you see robotics as a subject that should be mandatory, elective, or extracurricular in schools? Why?
- Not really
- Depends on the school's SES, demographic, and funds
- Potentially more suited for senior cohorts than junior cohorts

9. How do you think students of different age groups (e.g., primary vs. secondary) might benefit differently from learning robotics?
- Early exposure in primary school builds confidence for studying robotics in secondary school
- Students can build a foundation in primary and exhibit mastery in secondary

#### Future of Robotics in Education
10. What are your thoughts on the future of robotics in education? Do you think it will become a staple in all schools?
- Depends on the schools
- Likely more prominent in secondary schools than primary

11. How can schools best support teachers in integrating robotics into their curriculum?
- Provide professional development and technical support
- Offer access to resources, time for planning, and training students

12. What do you think the role of parents should be in encouraging their children to learn about robotics?
- Show interest and curiosity toward technology and robotics
- Encourage problem-solving to build resilience
- Get involved in their children’s learning journey

#### Personal Insight
13. If you had access to more resources, how would you like to incorporate robotics into your teaching?
- Establish STEM rooms/labs
- Develop a dedicated robotics curriculum
- Integrate robotics across disciplines, aligned with the Victorian - Curriculum
- Organize lunchtime robotics clubs

14. What advice would you give to other educators who are hesitant about introducing robotics into their classrooms?
- Be a role model and show curiosity toward robotics learning
- Learn together with the students
- Seek professional development and collaborate with colleagues
- Use consistent terminology and integrate robotics into a P-6 curriculum scope

15. Are there any specific skills or competencies that you think are essential for teachers to effectively teach robotics?
- Knowledge of curriculum integration
- Classroom management and technological proficiency
- Strong communication, collaboration, creative, and critical thinking skills
- Ability to assess and evaluate learning outcomes

The feedback provided valuable insights into teachers' needs and concerns, such as the need for simple user interfaces, easy-to-follow lesson plans, and robust support systems to help them successfully integrate BugBox into their curriculum. These findings informed my recommendations on developing the teacher dashboard for BugBox, focusing on providing teachers with streamlined tools, detailed guides, and interactive content to enhance the robotics learning experience.

## Conclusion
Overall, the research confirmed that teachers are open to adopting robotics in their teaching but require a supportive framework, including intuitive software and well-structured lesson plans. As a result, I am now focusing on optimizing the BugBox teacher dashboard to address these needs, which will enhance the usability of the platform, enabling teachers to confidently incorporate robotics into their classrooms. This user-centric approach will ensure that BugBox becomes a valuable tool in modern education, empowering teachers and students alike.
