Once logged in, teachers can easily switch between tabs by clicking on the tab titles on the left side of the screen. Each tab is color-coded, providing visual cues for easier navigation. As teachers hover over the tabs, they will change to their respective colors, enhancing the user experience and making it clear which section they are in.

#### 1: Student Tab
The Student Tab provides a comprehensive list of students, showcasing their individual information and progress. Teachers can easily view and track each student's learning journey. By clicking on any of the progress bars next to a studentâ€™s name, teachers are directed to Tab 3, where they can delve deeper into specific student metrics and performance details.

#### 3: Report Tab
The Report Page offers detailed insights into a student's individual progress. Here, teachers can analyze performance metrics, identify strengths and weaknesses, and make informed decisions about future instruction. This tab serves as a vital resource for understanding each student's capabilities and areas needing improvement.

#### 4: Freeze/Unfreeze Tab
The Freeze/Unfreeze Tab is a valuable tool for classroom management. If a teacher needs to pause students' activities to address the class, they can freeze the students' screens, allowing for focused instruction without distractions. Once the discussion is complete, teachers can easily unfreeze the screens, enabling students to resume their work.

In addition to these functionalities, the dashboard enhances usability with visual feedback; hovering over the tabs on the left changes them to their respective colors, including the freeze and unfreeze buttons. This feature not only improves the aesthetic appeal but also provides clear, immediate feedback to the teacher, creating a user-friendly experience.
