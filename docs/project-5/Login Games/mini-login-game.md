:::info
By **Parami Liyanage**
:::

The purpose of the game is to match draggable images with their corresponding drop zones. Each image must be placed in its correct zone to successfully complete the game. Once all drop zones are correctly filled, the user can proceed to the "Go Play" button to navigate to join playground.

## Features
- **Drag-and-Drop Interaction:**
    - Implemented using the react-dnd library.
    - Provides a smooth and intuitive user experience with visual feedback during dragging.
-	**Error Handling:**
    - 	Displays a modal (LogingameError) if an image is dropped into an incorrect zone.
    - 	Allows users to retry without restarting the game.
-	**Dynamic UI Feedback:**
     - Correctly placed images fade out from the draggable area.
    - Drop zones display visual feedback when an image is dragged over them.
-	**Progress Tracking:**
    - 	The game dynamically tracks which zones are completed using state.
    - 	When all zones are filled, a "Congratulations" message is displayed, and the "Go Play" button becomes active.
-	**Responsive Layout:**
    -	Fully responsive design built with Bootstrap.
    -	Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices.
-	**Randomised Images:**
    - everytime the page loads, the images in the drag and drop zone are randomised.

## Notes
After completing the game, to login to playground make sure bugbox backend app is running as well.

:::danger[Important:]
For future development if drag and drop functionality is needed using **react-dnd**, we can just simply add this element as a child in the router.
**see `Router.tsx` in Playground repository**
