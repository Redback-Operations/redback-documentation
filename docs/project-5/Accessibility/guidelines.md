# Accessibility Guidelines for Developers

:::info

## Introduction

Ensuring that applications and websites are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, is crucial. We will focus on actionable guidelines to make digital content more inclusive. By following these steps, BugBox’s dev team can create applications that are navigable, usable, and enjoyable for everyone.

To achieve this, it’s essential to adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1), which outline best practices for creating accessible web content. These guidelines focus on areas such as providing text alternatives for non-text content, ensuring keyboard navigation, improving color contrast, and making multimedia accessible. Following WCAG 2.1 ensures that your application is universally accessible, legally compliant, and inclusive for all users.

## 1. Provide Alternative Text for Images and Media

### Goal:

Ensure that non-text content like images, audio, and videos are accessible to users with visual and hearing impairments.

### How to Do It:

- **Alt Text for Images**: Always provide descriptive alt text for every image.

    Example:

    ```html
    <img src="robot.png" alt="A small robot building blocks">
    ```

- **Transcripts for Audio**: Provide a text version of all audio content.

    Example:

    ```html
    <audio controls>
      <source src="lesson.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      <p>Your browser does not support the audio element. <a href="transcript.txt">Download the transcript here.</a></p>
    </audio>
    ```

- **Captions for Videos**: Include captions for all video content.

    Example:

    ```html
    <video controls>
      <source src="lesson.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <track src="captions_en.vtt" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" label="English">
    </video>
    ```

### Why:

Users with visual or hearing impairments need alternative text or transcripts to access non-text content. Without this, they may miss out on critical information.

## 2. Organize Content with Headings and Structure

### Goal:

Make content easy to navigate for all users, especially those using screen readers.

### How to Do It:

- **Use Proper Headings**: Organize content with a logical order of headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.).

    Example:

    ```html
    <h1>BugBox Overview</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>What We Do</h3>
    ```

- **Add Navigation Landmarks**: Use ARIA landmarks to define sections like navigation and main content.

    Example:

    ```html
    <nav role="navigation">
      <!-- Navigation links -->
    </nav>

    <main role="main">
      <!-- Main content -->
    </main>
    ```

### Why:

Clear headings and structured content help users, especially those with visual impairments, navigate the page more easily and understand its structure.

## 3. Improve Keyboard Navigation

### Goal:

Ensure that all elements on the page can be used with the keyboard.

### How to Do It:

- **Test with Keyboard**: Navigate your site using only the Tab key and ensure all interactive elements are reachable.
- **Ensure Focusable Elements**: Ensure buttons, links, and form fields can be focused on and activated by the keyboard.

    Example:

    ```html
    <button>Click Me</button> <!-- Should be accessible via keyboard -->
    ```

- **Create Custom Keyboard Shortcuts**: For custom elements like sliders, make them keyboard accessible using ARIA roles.

### Why:

Not all users can use a mouse, and ensuring full keyboard accessibility is vital for users with motor impairments or when using devices without a mouse.

## 4. Make Forms Accessible

### Goal:

Ensure forms are easy to use for all users, especially those with disabilities.

### How to Do It:

- **Label Fields Clearly**: Each form field should have a `<label>` linked to the field using the `for` attribute.

    Example:

    ```html
    <label for="username">Username</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username">
    ```

- **Group Related Fields**: Use `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` to group related fields together.

    Example:

    ```html
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Contact Information</legend>
      <label for="email">Email</label>
      <input type="email" id="email" name="email">
    </fieldset>
    ```

- **Ensure Good Contrast**: Make sure text stands out from the background for users with low vision.

### Why:

Clear labeling and grouping of form elements make it easier for users with disabilities to understand and complete forms.

## 5. Optimize for Different Screen Sizes

### Goal:

Ensure the app works seamlessly on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

### How to Do It:

- **Responsive Design**: Use CSS media queries to adjust your design based on screen size.

    Example:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
      .container {
        flex-direction: column;
      }
    }
    ```

- **Scalable Elements**: Use relative units (like `em` or `rem`) instead of fixed sizes for fonts and layout elements.

### Why:

Responsive design ensures your app is usable on any device, providing a smooth experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop platforms.

## 6. Simplify Navigation

### Goal:

Make it easy for all users to find what they need.

### How to Do It:

- **Keep Navigation Consistent**: Ensure the main navigation is always in the same place across pages.
- **Offer Multiple Navigation Methods**: Include features like search, breadcrumbs, or a site map.
- **Use ARIA Roles**: Mark sections with ARIA roles like `role="navigation"` and `role="main"` to assist screen readers.

### Why:

Simple, consistent navigation makes it easier for users to find content, especially for those who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation.

## 7. Improve Color Usage

### Goal:

Don’t rely on color alone to convey information.

### How to Do It:

- **Use Color and Text Together**: For errors or success messages, use both color and text (e.g., red text for errors, green for success).
- **Check Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background. Use a contrast checker to verify it meets accessibility guidelines.

### Why:

Color blindness and other visual impairments can make it difficult for users to perceive information conveyed only by color. Adding text or icons helps make information clear to everyone.

## 8. Regular Testing and Feedback

### Goal:

Ensure your app is accessible and usable.

### How to Do It:

- **Test with Screen Readers**: Use tools like NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (macOS) to test if content is being read aloud correctly.
- **Use Accessibility Tools**: Run automated tests using tools like WAVE or Lighthouse to catch common issues.
- **Get User Feedback**: Conduct testing with real users who have disabilities to find areas for improvement.

### Why:

Regular testing with real users and tools ensures your app remains accessible and usable for people with disabilities, helping you find and fix problems.

## Conclusion

By following these accessibility guidelines, you can make your application more inclusive and usable for users with various disabilities. Consistently testing, incorporating feedback, and adhering to WCAG 2.1 standards will ensure your app is accessible, user-friendly, and compliant with legal requirements.
