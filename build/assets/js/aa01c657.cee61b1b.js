It intercepts and blocks requests to ad and tracking domains for all devices connected to a private network, ensuring comprehensive protection. Developed in 2014 by Jacob Salmela as an open-source alternative to AdTrap, Pi-hole is optimized for low-power devices like the Raspberry Pi but can also run on almost any Linux-based system.\r\nUnlike traditional browser-based ad blockers, Pi-hole operates at the network level, filtering ads across all connected devices, including websites, smart TVs, and mobile devices. It uses customizable blocklists and powerful tools like FTLDNS to efficiently block ads and trackers. Additionally, Pi-hole supports advanced features such as DNS-over-HTTPS and network monitoring, giving users more control over their network traffic. With its open-source nature and flexibility, Pi-hole provides an effective and scalable solution for improving network privacy and managing unwanted content.
