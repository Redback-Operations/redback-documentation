In upgrading the device in this manner, so too will the price become modular, with schools being able to customise their purchasing to suit the current needs of the students, only buying what the accessories necessary to them. Expanding on this platform provides further growth in the BugBox curriculum, with the opportunity to grow challenges and tasks based off the functionality of extra modules.
