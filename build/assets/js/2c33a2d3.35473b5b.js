The manual is primarily designed to equip Redback Operations with the tools, strategies, and best practices needed to effectively restore systems,data, and operations after a security breach.

For example, employees can directly access Redback systems and abuse their rights to steal confidential data for personal gain or inadvertently reveal confidential information by tampering with company assets.
