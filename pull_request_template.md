- If you are creating a new sub-folder, does it have a `_category_.json` file with the appropriate descriptive information?
- Are all your images / videos named appropriately and in the correct location ("image1.png" e.g. will not be accepted)
- Are all your code blocks properly closed off?
- Does your file have an appropriate and descriptive file name, and main header?
